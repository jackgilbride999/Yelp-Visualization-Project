We happen to be in the plaza and saw this place for bubble tea, so we decided to grab a few to go.

First of all, the two menus is located in a very awkward place (one very high up on the wall and one in the corner also by the wall), set up is not really friendly neither can it accommodate a large group of people to look at the menu at the same time.

The menu items itself had different options than your typically bubble tea place. Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. 

For a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).

The service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.

We had ordered the following:
- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)
- peach ice tea
- roasted oolong milk tea
- supernova kumquat lemonade

And when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. 

The mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.

I guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.

It had just opened when I started going and I walked in off the street because I figured I'd take a chance, it looked clean and it was close to home. 
I was greeted by the owner, a pleasant Chinese woman, who did my nails that day. Since then, I've been back at least once a month for manicures and pedicures. Those are the only things I've had done, but I would suspect that the other services are pretty good as well. 
The spa is new and everything is spacious and clean. They have massaging chairs for pedicures and the prices are reasonable. 
It's a basic nail place, so the bells and whistles are not numerous, but that suits me fine because it keeps the price down, allows for walk-ins and gets you in and out pretty quickly. 
Some of the ladies in the salon do a better job than others, but no one does a bad job. I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. 
In this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business. Good for them AND for me!

My expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices, good food (because eggs are hard to mess up), fast turnover and service. This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. 

The last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile. Finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table, because they lacked space. 

The waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order. I ordered eggs and bacon and toast. We also each ordered fruit smoothies. I asked for mine without banana. The waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face, ""The guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie!"" 

It took me a minute to realize she was joking....heh....

We played several rounds of Scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out. Our drinks were no where to be seen. We had to ask twice for them. By then we were almost done the food!

The food was alright, but I usually go to places like Egg Smart and for the cost, they give you way more food, for a better price and honestly, I think it tastes way better. These famous ""Boom frites"" are just thick, cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast! 

Anyway, if you're in the area and really want some breakfast, it's not terrible, but I think you can do way better!

A few years ago, Sheppard Centre was an alright place. When I lived at Yonge and Sheppard, there was a grocery store across the street and all the basics you would need st Sheppard Centre and it was good. 

Sheppard Centre is at a major subway stop, in a hugely busy area, but somehow stores keep failing here. 

That being the case, there are a few stores that are nice and handy. I would consider this mall for errands, now that I live away...except that the major reason for coming is gone now.

Sheppard Centre used to have 1 hour of free parking, which is a huge draw. You could go and park, run in and pick up your mail, or something from Shoppers Drug Mart and be on your way. They got rid of that. Not only that, but it's $3.50 for half an hour or under!

I think this is pretty pathetic for a crappy mall. 

""OH, but they have to pay for their excellent staff!"" you say?

Yeah, let me tell you about the staff that work there. First of all, you should also know that the ticket machine to pay for your parking tickets likes to break down ALL THE TIME, so you have to go to the parking garage and drive up to the ticket booth, park in the non-parking spots, block traffic and go in and pay the guys sitting around in the office...an office with TV screens of the parking garage, where our car has been broken into before...but it's not their fault. There are SIGNS that say they are not liable. Soooo...what are the TV screens for? To WATCH peoples' cars get broken into and laugh?

Right, so back to the story! 

Before I knew what to do when the machines broke down, I went to the in-mall security\/info booth to ask. The guy was behind the booth, on the phone, having a personal conversation. He saw me, but turned away and continued for ten minutes. Finally he got off the phone and made like he was coming over...only to turn away at the last second and start going through some papers. Finally I called out and said, ""Excuse me?"" He told me he was busy and made a point of moving towards me as slowly as possible.

This isn't the only time a staff member has been rude to me before. Dogs are allowed in the subway, so I was walking through once, to the subway entrance, HOLDING my dog, in my arms and a security guard chased me down to tell me dogs are not allowed. I told him I was just heading to the subway, so he followed me there to make sure. Yeah, because I really wanted to take my dog to the dollarstore and was clearly lying. GO STOP PEOPLE FROM BREAKING INTO CARS! 

Bayview Village, down the street, or one subway stop over, has a Shoppers, a grocery store, a post office, a Blacks photography and clothing stores...like Sheppard Centre. It also has a Chapters with a Starbucks, an LCBO, GOOD restaurants and the people there are polite, the bathrooms nicer than mine at home AND parking is free.

So basically Sheppard Centre can bite me. I'm done with them.",11,10,3

We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: ""The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels.""
We looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.
Now, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.
Rooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that ""all the rooms have been updated in SOME way""...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!
The hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.

Hotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8\/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.

Service: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.

The thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.

SO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.",3,1,1

We went here on a Saturday night. It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!

The atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. 

Service was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. 

Now to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.

That said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. 

The brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. 

The desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. 

Overall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me. I'm not opposed to going back, but it's not my first choice. My major reason for going back will be for convenience, because it is so close to us.",0,0,0

The gelato was good, but certainly wasn't the best I've had. It was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection wasn't huge. 

That said, they have some interesting flavours. I personally tried Twix and birthday cake and they were both very good. The more traditional flavour I tried (creme caramel) was a little boring and lacked flavour. 

My husband had the strawberry, Skor and chocolate. All fine, none blew me away.

Okay, so the gelato is good, if not the ""best""! But perhaps that's being picky. If I'm in the area and want some dessert, this place is great and I can imagine in the summer it's fantastic.

So why the three stars?? First of all you can only get gelato in two sizes - regular and large. There is no small option and both of those options are quite large. If you only want a taste of gelato, there is no option for you! 

Secondly, although this place is named for it's gelato, it also specializes in cupcakes. We got a cupcake to bring home. When asked if we would like it packaged to bring home we said yes...and they threw it in a bag. The girl apologized and said they had nothing appropriate to package it in. Why did you offer then?? But furthermore, YES YOU DO! You literally have perfectly shaped round cups to put gelato in everywhere! Guess what shape cupcakes are??

Oh well, no biggie.

So, since this place is about the gelato and the cupcakes, you may be interested in the cupcakes...well the taste was overall good, but it was a very oily cupcake. The icing especially. The cake was moist, which is good...except it was SO moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere! 

So what's the final synopsis. This place isn't bad. It has some delicious options. But nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws, which prevent me from giving it a better score. We'll see how I feel if it's a boiling hot summer day and I go in there for gelato though...I may be singing a different tune!",2,0,0

I explained that it had been put there BY an employee. The manager was brought out and she was immediately snarky and rude towards me. She said she wouldn't accept a charm that was ""all worn and beat up"". I encouraged her to look at the charm. She could clearly see it was in pristine condition. She glanced at my bracelet as a whole, but did not look at the charm, instead insisting that she could tell.

Seriously lady, you don't stand by your product at all? Your jewellery is so crappy it just gets beaten up and looks like crap after being worn for probably an hour total?!? This wasn't even my fault!!! Plus, she could clearly see from my bracelet that I had spent a LOT of money on my bracelet and am a loyal customer.

The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland ""bun"". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)

The noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired.

One of the major problems was finding it though. Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. 
Once inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! 
My brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. 
We ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. 
As I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. 
The desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. 
I think everyone left feeling really satisfied. 
It did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.
Basically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak\/not working.

First of all, I find that this location seems to be sold out of things less often than others. This is an overall problem with the Sephoras in this city - they sell out of things and don't restock often enough. 
One of Sephora's policies is that if you are, at any time, unhappy or unsatisfied with a product, you can return or exchange it.
I bought a cream eyeliner from this Sephora several months ago and used about half of it before it decided to dry out (even though I had been keeping the lid on it). I took it back actually because I was hoping there might be some cream or something I could add, that would make it creamy again. 
No need! They offered to give me a new one, or exchange mine. I chose exchange and they gave me a new brand that they said was excellent AND said they would mention the problem to the sales rep that was coming in for that brand next week. Not that I expect big things to come from that per say, but I'm happy they didn't just blow it off!
My only problem with Sephora (all of them) is that you need to make an appointment in advance to get makeup put on and you are required to spend a certain amount of money, while every other makeup seller does this service for free and accommodates walk-ins. I just hear people asking about it a lot and I had a party to go to one night and was downtown and wanted someone to help me touch up my makeup (without doing it myself using samples in the store) and they were very reluctant to help.

Not only that, but the facility for waxing is pretty pitiful. It's a VERY small room, with the ""bed"" pushed up against a wall. When I went in the summer it was very warm, so I'm not sure if there are A\/C or not. The other wall is entirely windows, which of course always have the blinds closed. It's a weirdly appointed room for a waxing area. Perhaps it was originally a storage closet? With windows?? I don't know, but it's not as though you're going here and paying more because the atmosphere is so much nicer! Anyway, as I said, this place is used in a pinch and now, I'm not sure I'd bother using it for that either!",7,0,0
nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ,Katherine,kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ,"""Plantation Animal Clinic""",5,27-01-2013,"I went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date night. I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and I'm glad I did, but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table. I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! 

I have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small ""mall"" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! 

The decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. 

Two of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. 

They were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. 

Our appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!

The main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!

The lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. 

I had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! 

The reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? 

I was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. 

Finally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. 

This place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. 

I will definitely come back some time in the future.",1,0,1

I went with a bunch of friends from work. Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti, which was great (and I'm not a huge wine drinker). 
The ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates, garnished with a garlic bread crouton. I don't think the salads were anything special, but I find that caesar salads in general aren't, so peoples' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded. 
I ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer...OMG it was SO good. Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap, with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction....to DIE for. 
For my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan (but grilled veggies instead of the pasta), the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce, a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food. One woman I was with IS a chef, so I feel like that was saying something. 
Now, since I didn't taste their dishes, I can only expand on my own. The sauce was to DIE for. Creamy, complex and delicious. The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat! 
Since we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations, we went for it and ordered dessert (even though we were all stuffed). We all ordered the white chocolate creme br√ªl√©e, except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed. Our creme br√ªl√©es were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside. Perfect! The tiramisu was apparently great, served very untraditionally in a large plate, with an indentation like a bowl in the middle. 
I was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos, so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great!

Altogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price. 

The restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.   

The service was excellent. Our waitress saw to our every need, answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly. 

So, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems.

I had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good, but the second time was a hot mess. It looked like a five year old did my nails for me. I went home and took the polish off. But this is the kicker:
I couldn't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by, so I decided to give it a try (obviously the nail girl wouldn't be doing my hair). I went in and sat down the a woman with an Eastern European accent  came to talk with me. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples....none of which looked like my picture, but I always assume the hair dressers know what's best. Now, you're all thinking, ""..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour..."" right? 
Nope, she told me she couldn't do my hair because I had lice! Of course I freaked out. Another hair dresser came over to see if I was alright and I was mortified. She asked if I had experienced any itching. I said no. This hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it wasn't too bad yet, but original hairdresser said it was really, really bad. I freaked out and left (obviously without having anything done) and went to a Shoppers and bought lice shampoo. I went home and had my husband look at my hair. He looked and looked and could find nothing. I still didn't want to take chances, so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor looked at my head and ALSO said there was nothing there! 
Since I was paranoid, I still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest I went to examine it. But even with my husband and mother looking at my head, we never found a single thing. We didn't even see dandruff!! I went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful...but dry at the ends...yeah, because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo! Thanks a lot you crazy woman!
So ultimately, I never had lice. I don't know if this woman just decided she didn't feel like doing my hair, or if she was delusional, but I sure won't be going back there EVER again. No one else should either, unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced.",7,9,0

So I'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places. I was in Scarborough Town Centre and came upon this kiosk. It's not a storefront, but a rather ingenious booth, with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes. 

There is a long list of flavours and I suspect (as with many places) they make different cupcakes for different days. 

I ordered 6, which was $18...I know, it's steep, that's pretty standard. Cupcake places seem to range from around the $2.25 mark to around $4\/cupcake. So these guys fall somewhere inbetween. But not cheap, so I expect excellence, needless to say.

Now, here's the strange thing. On their website each cupcake is listed as $2.90....was this the case at the store?? I sure hope not. Why would you have to pay MORE for buying more? Maybe it's an ordering online thing? Anyway, my GUESS is that you're paying $3\/cupcake at the store, or $18 for 6. No real incentive to buy 6. But I did, so moving on....

Of course I chose a range of flavours: oreo cookie. chocolate with vanilla icing, salted caramel, lemon and a double chocolate. 

Over two days we managed to work our way through them (myself and my husband) and I nibbled the different flavours. Lemon was my favorite, by far, with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment. It was entirely too salty. More salt than caramel. It wasn't very good at all.

But that said, none of the cupcakes really blew me away. AND in fact, they were VERY stale the next day, despite being stored in an airtight container, in the fridge. Luckily, the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes, they softened up a bit. 

The bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired. 

I was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of Christmas flavours or designed. Right before Christmas you would expect some special flavours...maybe a candy cane, or gingerbread cupcake. It would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a Christmas party dessert.

The restaurant is tacky, stereotypical, but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated. 

The menu has basic Mexican fare, burritos, fajitas, tacos, with your choice of meat. Nothing too outside of the box, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

We arrived first and our table was waiting for us. The restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu.

Once our party finally arrived we all ordered. I had their Chipotle Sweet Potato & Goat Cheese Dip, which was average. The salads looked much better and got better reviews. Same with the soup. The dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle. The dip was good, the pickled cauliflower alright. It was nice when all combined on the crostini (pickled veggies, dip on top of crostini). 

I had originally wanted to order the double pork slider, but I saw it arrive at someone else's table and it was literally just the one, single mini pork sandwich, with a few thinly cut fries at the side. It looked good, but it was appetizer size, IF THAT. The chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized, so I ordered that. It was good. I really liked the bread. The macaroni was also more reasonably sized. I sampled it and it was fine. Didn't blow me away. 

Dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone I think. Some people ordered the mousse, which I thought was fine, but the people who ordered it loved, so there you have it. My husband loved his apple terrine, which I tried and was good. I liked the flavour of my creme brule very much, but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin, hard candy. It was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth. 

The service was consistently good, so no complaints there. None of us had wine with our lunch (although some had other drinks), so I can't comment there. 

This is a tapas bar, so I expect sizes to be small. BUT when sizes are small I expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions.

Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a ""salad"" with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. 
We each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share. We ordered two vegetarian options, one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef. Basically, the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera, which are sort of bland, cold, bread-like stuff, which comes rolled up. They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. 
Once we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). 
We asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted. Then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups. The coffee was so rich, it was almost like chocolate.

So first off, the store owner responded to my complaints...by blaming me. Apparently it is MY fault they sent the wrong thing, because I sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call...which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something. Which makes zero sense, because two orders were not sent. And the person I was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails I sent with codes to try out....so I have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different. 

They also told me they blocked me on instagram because I was body shaming their models. I want to be VERY clear on this. I never once body shamed, or made any comments on instagram about their models. I asked why they were promoting clothing they don't even have in stock on instagram...apparently that equates to body shaming to them. 

They also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me (3), they were going to start to charge me for shipping. They seemed to forget that I had also been paying to ship items back to them and that I had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders. It's not that they weren't charging me for shipping...it was that I was taking advantage of their own promos. Apparently I can't use their promos anymore, because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now. At least for me. 

They did not address the code not working. 

I responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be. 

Then I did some research and sent another email. Instead of returning the dress I would donate it to Dress for Success. I said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth. My request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good. I asked that they take the remaining $9.98 credit I had and put it towards them making a small donation, either monetarily or a piece of clothing, also to the charity. I stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to, but if they wouldn't do it for me, perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need. I said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness.

Their generosity is astounding. NOW, I don't know that they haven't made their own donation and just not told me of course...I'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service, well...I think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject. No further correspondence was sent from the actual store. 

But at any rate, I am donating the new dress to Dress for Success (along with my $9.98) and I am officially done with this store for good. And I sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here. The clothes are not good quality, but more than that...I have NEVER experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life. Zero regard for their customers, zero regard for their own mistakes, zero regard for taking ownership of...anything! Just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers. These people do not deserve your business and quite frankly...ladies you deserve better. Better clothing (I have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them...loose threads, flimsy, cheap fabric, wrong stitching for the fabric, no lining, incorrect fit for size, etc.) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer.",1,0,0

One of my favs, Chimichanga's, has disappeared, so we got to a point where we were just calling around to see WHO could take us. Finally...La Revolucion answered!

We walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!

She took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two burritos, one plate of tacos and one quesadilla and guacamole bites (which is basically nachos and guac). 

The guac came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!

Burritos were a bit bland. Needs some sauce in, or on top. Quesadillas were the same...nothing special. The tacos got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about. 

The back area houses a sort of club-like atmosphere, which is described in blogto as: ""...dark textured walls and ambient lighting, it is the opposite of its cocina counterpart. Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...""

When we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a ""dance party"". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.

I think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. 

I WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their ""secret recipe"" and were amazing. I had two actually.

Anyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future. Don't think I'll be going for any dance parties!",4,0,0

My first thought though was that the restaurant was freezing cold inside, but the atmosphere was nice and the waitress was lovely.

She told us the soup of the day, which was potato garlic and said it could be ordered as a side dish. My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in. It had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast, but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough. THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.

The soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. 

She was right! It really helped the soup. She said she does this with soups here all the time...which I'm not sure if a very complimentary review of the soups.

My friend said her salad was great and she liked the pepper, but agreed the cheese in the soup made it better.

Firstly, I should mention that the menu is very small. Most of the food has an Italian feel to it (it IS in Little Italy), but that feels a bit strange given the huge martini list. 

We were hungry though, so we ordered dinner and it was honestly pretty good! I'm not sure if this would be my choice if I was JUST looking for dinner out, but not bad if you're feeling lazy, and not wanting to bother going somewhere different for your alcohol and food, like what we were feeling. 

This is a martini bar and so no big surprise, it has a lot of martinis. That said, I shall repeat it...it has a LOT of martinis!! Over 100 different martinis and every one of the ones I tried, I enjoyed. And I tried a good five or something. This may ALSO account for my remembering a good time.

The service was good too. When I mentioned that I really liked the sauce my pasta came in, the waiter brought me extra sauce in a dish, with bread to dip it in. Weird, but I really enjoyed this...what can I say? I had had like 5-6 martinis!

That was why we chose to order from this place and it was a BIG mistake. My husband called and placed the order and we got a call back saying they had taken down his credit card number incorrectly. Then they called back a few minutes later because they needed directions to our place. 
We proceeded to get three more calls from a driver asking us where to go. The confusing thing was that he would ask, but then either carry on a conversation on another phone, or with someone who was with him, instead of listening. Then he would ask for my husband to repeat himself. This happened at least twice every call, for three calls. 

Turns out they took the address down completely wrong. Big surprise, considering their listening skills. 

We finally got our food and they had screwed up the order and given us a wrong sushi roll. Either way the sushi was among the worst we have tasted. It was a mixture of bland and salty! Basically it was terrible. 

On a side note, their dragon rolls are actually unagi rolls. Dragon rolls are called dragon rolls (at EVERY other sushi place) because they have avocado on top, making them green. It is very strange that these guys have decided that that's not the way they want to go.

nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ,Katherine,pZ1quwXnYozLIZIVABojhw,"""Impact Auto Glass & Tint""",4,13-01-2013,"This place is a bit of an adventure...at least for me. I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. 

The four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and p√¢t√©), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. 

The dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the ""ugly"" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. 

Next was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. 

We had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. 

Finally we had the tacos, which was probably the more ""normal"" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. 

The foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. 

So what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.

Overall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. 

Those are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to!

The restaurant is clean and trendy looking and we took a seat, against the wall, in the back. We ordered the platter for two. Since we had never been, it felt like a good idea to try it ALL out. GREAT idea! We were delivered a platter of food that included two schnitzels, two cabbage rolls, 6 perogies and some other sides.

I should mention that it was a lot less improv than I expected. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was basically, short, individual skits, creating a sort of sketch comedy act, as opposed to improv. This isn't a bad thing. I'm a HUGE fan of SNL, but I was say that I probably laughed more consistently during this performance, than your average episode of SNL. This is because of a combination of personal ""current Toronto"" jokes and because that's the way it should be when you have a couple of months to be putting together your next show, as opposed to one week (as with SNL). I would only expect a more refined show. In addition, we came close to the end of this show's run, so the kinks would presumably be figured out and they told us they were testing some of the new material on us, so that was kind of cool! 

The skits were mostly successful, none failed to make us laugh out loud at least once. There were no weak links in terms of the actors, but the stand outs (for me) were a red headed girl and the black guy....sorry I have no names! I can only go by really obvious characteristics. 

We stuck around after, as they did a little bit of actual improv and another skit, which seemed like an idea they were trying to hash out a little more. Well worth the sticking around even later for!

Why the lack of one star? Well those pictures down below don't really accurately describe what this place looks like when it's full of people. The chairs are small, there is no coat check and you're all crammed around a very small table. Your coats end up...wherever basically. 

Probably because I booked the tickets on the Wednesday before (I'm not sure how they determine seats...it's not first come, first served and it's not on your ticket...that I could see), we originally ended up in a back corner, on high bar stools. My skirt made it so that I kept sliding off the seat! I asked if there was any way we could be moved into regular seats, but the only thing left (and this is how I know seats are prearranged, because there were tonnes of empty seats all around at that time), were right in the front, next to the stage, but to the far side. From this angle, you can't see everything, but we enjoyed it more being right up, near the action. 

That said, it was still VERY crowded and uncomfortable. Tickets are $30 each (here is a tip...it's a little less if you have a CAA membership and order through them), so that's pretty pricey. The show makes it worth it, it truly does. The seating takes away from it. 

BUT you can order drinks, which we did and that make just about anything better, so hey! 

At the end of the day, I'll just make sure I wear pants next time and order tickets further in advance and either way it won't stop me from checking out another performance. It's worth a night of non-stop laughter.",0,0,0

I also really like that they make their OWN tartar sauce. So few places seem to do this. You get like 1-2 of those little packets. 
One star off for having to buy the tartar sauce separately, and for it being rather small portions. I KNOW tartar sauce is not that premium of an item...why does no one include it in the price, or at least give a nice, proper portion? Such a small thing to make a big difference.

I had never been in before, because the price list was pricey, but decided that given my rush, I would bite the bullet and suck it up.

The people were all very pleasant. I said I was wearing a purple dress and asked for feedback on colours and they gave good opinions and were very nice. Then I was led into a back rooms, where I was instructed to sit on a padded bench and put my feet in a large, metal bowl of water. THIS was a new one. I have never had to put my feet in a mixing bowl while getting nails done.

The seat, while padded, was not particularly comfortable and it was awkward getting up on it and off it again. The pedicure was standard with most places I have been.

The nails were more in keeping with what I was used to, sitting at a nail table. I said I was in a bit of a rush, but she still seemed to really take her time. I didn't push it, because I didn't want to be rude. The nails were fine, but not perfect...some have some bubbling in the polish and others are a bit crooked.

Here's the kicker though...the bill came to $60!! That's almost twice as much as other nail places and it's certainly not a better place in terms of the facilities and job they do! That doesn't even include tip.

The people in there were all older and seemed to be regulars, so I guess they have a customer base, but I certainly won't be part of that! Even in a rush, this place was just not worth it.

They informed us this was because it was almost close, although close wasn't till 7pm...so I guess this is more of a lunch place. That said they had one veal left and one penne pasta left. We bought them both. My toddler, who hates pasta usually, loved this pasta! And I agree with him. It was delicious. My husband liked the sandwich and I also took a bite and it was yummy.

We also bought some very expensive gelato, which was good (and apparently no preservatives, all natural, etc) but was very pricey at over $20 for the smallish tub. The sign in front of the gelato said large takeaway tub was $10...my husband paid, or I would have asked for clarification. I didn't know until after we left, so there was some miscommunication somewhere in there.

I find that sometimes you get great service the first few times and then they bomb completely. This salon was sort of average the first few times and bombed the third. 

I decided to go to this place  back in the fall, as I was looking for a new stylist. A girl from work goes to this place and said it was pretty good, so I figured I've give it a try. I went in with some different pictures and asked if I should go lighter with some highlights, or darker. The girl said darker, for no real apparent reason and dyed my hair dark brown. Not a hard job and it was fine. 

Second time I went back I wanted some highlights. A had a different girl this time and she gave me partial highlights and then a wash, which made the highlights barely noticeable. Then, because of the wash, it cost around $150! I thought again, it was fine. 

Third time, I wanted something a little more noticeable. I said I specifically wanted my highlights to stand out more this time. I wanted to avoid paying extra, for hardly any change. I brought in pictures and the same girl as last time got to work. 

When she was finshed I was not impressed with the results. There were very noticeable roots all around my head. Especially if you pulled my hair back from my ears, there were dark strips where the roots were and the highlights began. It was not natural. I complained about the roots, so she proceeded to take big sections of hair and bleach them completely, then rubbed the bleach off with a damp towel. It barely looked different when she had finished, but the store was basically past closed and it was clear she had no idea how to fix this mess anyway. 

I had to go and purchase one of those root touch-ups from Shoppers Drug Mart and fix my roots myself. After that, they were alright. Once again it was very expensive.

My friend has been going with me the last few times and I think she has liked her hair, but I won't be going back. I would have to ask specifically for a new stylist and I just don't want the awkwardness and frankly, I just don't trust anyone there anymore anyway. Once again, the search is on!",5,0,1

My husband ordered the pork hock and I had the pasta. His dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. My pasta however was very bland. the pasta noodles were overcooked and fell apart easily, making it hard to twist in my fork. The limited sauce had little flavour. The chicken and mushrooms in the pasta were the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me consider this a ""good"" dish. More like something I would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied.

As I said below, when I went to Moroco, it was expensive, but very delicious for a treat. So I decided that I wanted to have my birthday dessert there. I called up to make a reservation for about 10 people. I was informed that for groups of over ten, there is a requirement that every person spends $48! 

I kept the reservation for a day to see how many people were actually going to confirm coming out, but since everyone confirmed, I had to call back and cancel my reservation, because I do not want my guests to be obliged to spend $50 on dessert, after we have already had dinner! The girl on the phone said that it usually worked out, because once people had dessert and a drink, it worked out to be enough. As I said below, let's round up and say dessert is $20...so she's saying their drinks are $28!??! 

I have wanted to go to Moroco for my birthday since the summer, but that was before I realized how pretentious they are! No thanks! Chocolate is great there, but only go with a couple of people, otherwise you'll have to pay the price!

But, as I said, the pizzas we ordered were very good. Some stranger combinations were a big hit, like the pear pizza, which worked a bit like a dessert.

So we made reservations at O. Noir. Overall, it was a good time and a good laugh. 

One recommendation: Maybe don't wear your BEST clothes to this place, as there is a very really possibility that you will drop food on yourself. 

THE WAY IT WORKS: For those of you who don't know - You enter into a lounge with brick walls and dim lights. You pre-order your meal and can order drinks from the bar there. THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table. 

And it IS pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room. 

You are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind. This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. 

This is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great. This becomes more apparent when you can't even see the presentation of the food and are reliant entirely on taste. It needs to taste GREAT. This was distinctly forgettable food. 

I would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was. Basically, you could be in dirty, dank basement storage room and you'd never know! 

Finally, it's very expensive!

But I had this nagging feeling, because it wasn't a ""traditional Jewish bagel shop"". I swore I wouldn't give a full judgement until I had sampled bagels from Bagel World. Bagel World, which has a few locations in the city, boosts the best bagels IN the city. They also have weird hours though, making it hard to get to on a weeknight.

Decor: Another reviewer mentions that the decor seems to be missing something and I agree. It's boring. The booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part up. Hard to describe, but looks cheap and crappy, like they're broken. Our table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rocking. It's small and very cramped. 

Food: Selection was pretty standard pub fare, but a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if I wanted it to be spicy or mild I asked for it to be mild. Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake. The curry comes with the chicken in sauce, rice and a sort of fried crisp, which was nice. The rice was bland however...or the spice from the curry killed my tastebuds. 
My husband chose a burger, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger, which is expensive when your burger is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the cheese, I'll admit was really good on this burger. 

Atmosphere and Service: Service was fine. BUT, since this seems to be a trend...or the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out, we had another loud, rude child\/negligent parent situation (see post on Malaysian place). Another situation where children were screaming and running around and parents were sitting off, by themselves, ignoring them, while the rest of the people in the restaurant had to suffer. The group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath. 

Once again, this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurant. The kids were part of a party and were in a party room, which is adjacent, but separate from the rest of the dining room. This room had doors on it...which CLOSE, but were propped wide open. All the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doors. That's it! Problem solved. 

We were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering dessert. Too bad, because they actually looked great. The group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were.

So yeah...I actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid, but if the screaming kid had not been a problem, we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows, maybe these guys would be getting 3+ stars.

We have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.

First impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. 

Menu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. 

We both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. 

My drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. 

My soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. 

My husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. 

His drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.

We finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. 

We REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. 

We flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. 

It was pretty good, but nothing special.

Once we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. 

Finally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. 

So yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it.

Since I have been several times and never had a bad experience, I can only give my review of this place based on what I have experienced. 

That said, it seems like so many people have experienced bad service, that even I am wary of this place now. I have never been during ""peak"" hours, which may account for more attentive service.

As mentioned, I have been to this restaurant several times and really enjoyed myself. I love Mexican food and there doesn't seem to be enough good Mexican restaurants around, so I get excited when I find one with food I enjoy.

I have had their nachos, two types of tacos and a burrito at this place and enjoyed all of them. When I went with a girlfriend, we were advised to get two taco plates and share them, since they give you a few, small tacos on each plate. We did this and really enjoyed both dishes. 

The nachos were also great, having been piled high with toppings, not just your grated cheese and some tomatoes. 

Drinks were also good. I guess my one criticism would be the price, which I do think is a little high given that Mexican food is quite cheap to produce. I am guessing that the extra cost goes towards the atmosphere, which is trendy...but I gave this same review to another Mexican restaurant I went to in Florida and it looked like someone's kitchen, so I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.",2,0,2

The environment is very ""come-as-you-are"" (read: hippy), but it's such a laid back and accepting atmosphere.

The menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza and panzerotti. We went with what many people were raving about online and got panzerotti...fried ones. OH GOD HEART ATTACK. We also got the rice balls.

Okay, rice balls first: Lightly breaded, gooey cheese on the inside and sauce for dipping them in....SO GOOD.

The panzerotti...well this is where they lose one star...not on the food itself, but because they messed up our order.

It's a small place in a business district. The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.

After perusing their menu I decided to order a full slab of beef ribs, a order of mac and cheese and two orders of coleslaw. With a tip it came to $53

I wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.

We found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.

Neither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.

The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!

I did use the restroom while here and found it to be clean and sanitary.

We both ordered our meals. I ordered the club sandwich, My girl ordered a gyro. Both meals came some sort of a thick chicken rice soup with a lemon taste. The soup was good until my girl discovered a hair in hers. That kind of turned me off on eating anymore of it. We let that slide cause a random hair can happen now and then.

The sandwich was very good as was the gyro. Both servings were very large and filling. Neither of us could finish them. The waitress, after learning we planned on being in Boulder City for awhile, offered to put the leftovers in the fridge for us to pick up later. We declined but it was nice of her to offer.

I recently moved here from the Midwest, and had never eat cactus before.  (Turns out it's yummy!)  I had two burritos, and they were very good.

Cons: the food is given in very small portions.  Usually I don't complain about this because I'm a small person, and huge portions are usually a waste (or a doggie bag).  But I also have a healthy appetite, and found that one burrito was not enough.  So, if you've never been here, be on the safe side and order two of whatever you're thinking of ordering.  The tacos are even smaller, so maybe three.  And I'm talking about a normal person who's feeling an average hunger level.  If you're starving, please go elsewhere (haha).

All that being said, it's definitely worth going to.  This is Mexican food, made by people from Mexico - i.e., the way Mexican food Should be.  It's authentic.  If you're visiting Vegas, don't go to Taco Bell.  Please don't go to Taco Bell.  Go to Taco Y Taco, instead.",1,0,0

The staff was nice, but not well versed in the fine selection they had available to them. I also overheard one of them telling a customer next to me he was not that good at mixing drinks. I guess at least he is at a whiskey bar so many of the drinks will be neat or on the rocks.

We both love Scooby Do's. They treat my little butt-faced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that I perceive as being weird. Like that funny poofy pompadour. Mohawk it out, yo. Done. In like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass. Not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses. (He ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too. So adorable.)

The shampoo they use here is also amazing. Noodles usually smells like tacos (a combination of beef stank and corn chips) but after getting back from the Do's, he smelled like Christmas morning! Sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. He's got some gender identity issues to deal with. 

The pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there. I'm talking to you Petsmart! I've taken my other pup to Smelly Dog before, but unless I need dog sitting play time after the cut, I'll go with Scooby's. They genuinely seem to like my little Noodle monster.",3,2,0

The braised oxtails are heavenly, succulent and fall off the bone tender. They had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal. The plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides, and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce. 

The jerk chicken was also fantastic, but since I was so busy hoarding my oxtails I didn't get to try much of it. The jerk was smoky, spicy, and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it. Same sides, so at least we didn't have to fight over those. 

Make sure to try the hibiscus flower drink (sorrel) with cloves floating in it. It accompanies the earthy, spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at Mexican joints.

The atmosphere of this place is wonderfully warm and inviting. The eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the Caribbean, and the faux-rattan chairs help with the vibe too. There's also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place, but who am I to judge decor? Nothing in my house matches. 

In that respect it's kind of like being invited over to a friend's house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your Kraft mac n cheese house.

It was my father's birthday and I couldn't think of a thing to get the most unhelpful man ever. ""Whatta you want? Whatever. Like what? You don't have to get me anything."" Oh, but I do.

My beacon of hope was tucked away in a tiny little strip mall, sandwiched by a Dunkin' Donuts, a Japanese food mart and a liquor store, with a simple sign advertising, ""Irish Gifts."" Salvation! He's all about heraldry and Irish pride, but would the offerings be too chotchke to actually give anyone? Like leprechaun print boxers and Kiss Me I'm Irish ties he'd only wear one day during the year? 

Nope. This place is a class act. 

When I first entered the store I was shocked at how much stuff they had crammed onto the floor space. It would have been claustrophobic had they not utilized barriers (also decorated with stuff) that lead you into different areas of the store. The owners also run the place and immediately greeted me. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of Irish themed offerings. They had everything from the goofy offerings I had imagined to beautiful jewelry, china and crystal ware. They even had a whole section of imported Irish food, including tea, sweets and refrigerated stuff like sausages. He ended up with some glassware with decorative pewter insignias ranging from Celtic knots to Claddagh rings. 

The people who own it are friendly and immediately helpful in finding anything you need, ordering what they don't have or calling the competition to see if they can secure that special something, something I appreciate. I've been frequenting the place since, snatching up Guinness themed merchandise for friends and fun Irish gifts for other members of my family. My dad even purchased his wedding rings from the place and a lovely Celtic cake topper of a man and woman with knot work circling it.

(Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)

It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? 

So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate (""Um, I don't eat anything green..."") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.

The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. 

Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter\/busser\/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. 

Let's wrap it up:
-Don't bring picky eaters.
-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.
-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.
-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.
-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)

They'll serve it in just about any iteration of a ""tortilla + meat"" that Taco Bell has dreamed up six times over, but fact is you're stuck with either carne asada or al pastor.

Needless to say the meat should be mind blowing to carry such a limited menu. It was solid, but nothing to write home about. The al pastor tasted overly smoky and there was a strange tinge of sweetness underlying the pork flavor, while the carne asada was good but nothing a dozen other 'Bertos clones couldn't pound out.

But it's the pizza that's the big star here and I don't know if it's just me but it seems like there's been a slow but noticeable decline in its quality. Less toppings, burnt crust more often than not, cheese that seems to congeal in the five minutes it takes to go from box to mouth. They used to have a lot more hot sandwich and a drink specials too. Chicken parm, cordon bleu, meatball subs, all delicious! Just not offered with as much regularity or in as plentiful a portion as they used to be. 

Plus, and this might be a personal beef, but the drink that came with the two slices special has been scaled back to a much smaller cup. Have the extra couple gulps of soda per transaction really translated to that much of an increase in syrup costs? Is an extra six ounces of drink really hurting business?

One last point and I'll end this sigh-inducing session. The service at Mamma Mia's is really pretty crappy now.

I turn my head too quick, they take that as a cue to flap their little arms and fly off my head. I bend down to tie my shoe, they hurry to the tip of my nose for a better view. I fall asleep in them, and I'm not sure what kind of antics they get into, but I usually find them in disarray on the ground or tangled in the blankets. Maybe they just wanted to cuddle, but I'm pretty sure they're conspiring to elope to Vegas without me. 

But they're creatures of habit, so it's not too often they pull a fast one on me. (Although every time they do I'm sure they giggle their lenses off as I grope for them like a blind mole-like critter.) They recently hatched a new plan, easily the most devious of the bunch. Instead of working as a team they decided to take their chances solo and rendezvous at a meeting point. That meeting point happened to be my bathroom counter.

I set them down and *plop* what was once one piece was then two. I was so shocked that I conceded a good couple of days to them. Especially since they were willing to go to such extremes to get away from me! While they gloated over their victory I was stuck with my highly unflattering, scratched and cruddy Harry Potter glasses.

After a brief hiatus they agreed to reconcile for the sake of my nose (and my ego). So off to All-American Eyeglass Repair we went! We showed up and were promptly greeted by a young man at the counter. My glasses warmed to him immediately and I could practically hear them purring with contentment. It was an ocular spa day. 

He took my wily little friends into the back (gave 'em a quick massage), popped in a new screw (the happy ending on that massage), then tightened and re-bent (lil chiropractic work) them back into shape. 

Total cost: zero dollars and zero cents. 

My glasses must have sweet talked him while they were in the back because his only requirement was that we come back to him for all our glasses repair needs.

I adore this joint as both a bar and a restaurant. It has the best patio in all of Tempe, nay all of Phoenix, no--history. Alright, probably not history. I mean, if there were a bar in the middle of some wicked beautiful natural reserve, I'm sure it would trump Casey's. But I'm not qualifying their worth based on beauty. (Sorry, dearest. I'll make sure to spend freely this weekend to make up for that slight.) The five stars it gets is based on the general relaxing vibe it exudes.

It's far enough off the Mill Avenue strip that the douchebaggery of those bars rarely flows over into Casey's. I've seen that the only gripe most people have with this bar is the occasional frat boy that wanders onto the patio, but even though these specimens in their natural environment are prone to swinging their dicks and strutting with impunity, they act different once they're surrounded by the regular clientele. The regulars could care less that you're the beer pong champion or top sorority sex kitten, can you engage in a meaningful conversation? No? Then kindly take your bulging biceps and stilettos to Scottsdale, where you're sure to be appreciated.

I love the fact that this bar attracts such a broad range of people, all of whom coexist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and happy drunkenness. The elderly come here for the oysters, the hipsters come here to show off their newest tattoo. ASU professors coexist with high school dropouts. Professional bar hoppers chit chat with weekend warriors. The food's pretty wicked as well. 

French onion soup, the Hippie Sandwich, the Tuna Bacon Melt, the Fishwich (without bread it just becomes fish and chips, but way cheaper), the Oysters Rockefeller, the Chipotle Chicken Wings, the Clamstrip basket at 5 bucks a pop...it's greasy and divine. The prices aren't absurd, but are a little on the steep side for bar food, but it's totally worth it. And if you go for happy hour, there are free munchies inside near the dart board.

It's a lovely little pub with a great patio, friendly servers and decent drink prices. Go there often enough and I'm sure its subtle charm will capture your fancy (and your wallet), just as it has countless others.

Sure the vegan spinach and artichoke dip and many types of hummus are amazing, that's what Dr. Hummus and Co does very, very well. They made their name on the farmers market circuit and deserve props for making consistent, solid hummus and dips. It's just too bad they didn't just stick to that.

The soups and salads failed to impress. Either woefully lacking or overly aggressive in flavor, which means there's a quality control issue because no kitchen would send product out if it tasted that off. The GLT was pretty good, mainly because of the awesome spinach and artichoke dip slathered on thick.

To top it all off, you're paying serious farmer market prices. Everything is about 20 percent more expensive that it has any right to be. (Go check out Munch A Lunch on the other side of Tempe for a cheap, humble Mediterranean lunch joint that exceeds where Herb N Flavor fails.) 

Stick to a counter-ordering system for sandwiches. With cheap IKEA decor and only three tables full at lunch time, there's no need for four waitstaff to be wandering around aimless and looking for something, anything, to do. Payroll is way higher than it should be.

Which is why they're charging three bucks for a glass of iced tea. Or eight bucks for a thin slather of spinach and artichoke dip on a platter when I could buy a whole tub of the stuff for the same price. And then I have to tip a luckluster waitstaff on top of everything? I walked out 45 bucks lighter and seriously unimpressed.

The Downtown Phoenix Public Market is the perfect diversion from this routine! There are a wide variety of stands, especially considering it's such a small market, and there aren't that many tchotchke arts and craft offerings to be had. Just a couple candles and soap stands that are dominated by a lot of fresh and organic edibles. 

Some of the stands offer little samples of their wares, which of course I had to take advantage of. I had a sip of Hansen's orange creme soda, some iced tea, organic hummus with a pita chip and some interesting roasted Mexican seeds that the Aztecs used to cultivate. Those salty, crisp treats made a satisfying pop when I bit 'em, tasting nutty and delicious. Almost bought a bag. Thought better of it when I saw the guy selling baklava.

A small portion of baklava and kataifi was my only purchase, both of which were decadent sweet treats later on after lunch. The layered phyllo dough, the piles of nuts, the honey slathered on thick! It was divine. At 4 bucks for these two tiny squares, it wasn't the best bang for my buck, but the taste totally made up for the size, and when it's that orgasmicly good, size doesn't matter, go ahead and ask anyone. I was also tempted to pick up some pickled asparagus and some jalapeno jelly. Just for kicks.

There was a pretty good live folksy musical act when I was there too, so check out the entertainment if you happen to be in the area. And if you're stuck on a Saturday behind ten other groups vying for the butter soaked goodness of Matt's Big Breakfast, this little market is small enough that you can walk the entire extent of the lot, try all the samples they offer, and make it back to the corner of 1st and McKinley before your party is called.",4,2,6

This kind of bar act as repellent for those college aged kiddos. 

It might have something to do with the fact that it's really dark inside, illuminated by a couple lights and the glow of massive televisions that consume an entire wall of the bar.

Enjoyed the ginger carrot elixir, thought the pomegranate juice was mega overpriced, and why? Because of the omg!antioxidants? Potatoes have freakin' antioxidants but I'm not about to drink a tater slurry.

Tip 2: The food is chain-restaurant quality.

The apps are fairly meager and like everything else on the menu, too expensive for what you get. Hummus comes with a couple measly pita triangles, so make sure to ask for more. The caramelized onion tart is another small but tasty option to share between two people.

The TLT (tempeh, lettuce, and tomato) was a major bummer. The tempeh was cold and hard to bite through, the bread was so dry it tore up the roof of my mouth, and they left off the avocado and mayo. Bison burger was much more moist but practically fell apart upon first bite, so make sure you got a knife and fork at the ready. The kale salad and sweet potatoes are the bomb though. Consider just getting 'em solo to avoid a lackluster entree.

When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions.

How was I to know that little sneaker was would bring a smile to my face with a cutesy, cheesy, tchotchky gift and card combo?)

Little did he know that I had an ace up my sleeve. An ace with lots and lots of titacular action. Bombshells! I know that nothing brings a smile to Mr. Man's face quicker than a pair of boobies, so we stopped by on Sunday for some sinful indulgence in an illusionary atmosphere. Being a non-traditionalist doesn't have to be a bad thing.

Sundays are 2 for 1 well drinks and domestic bottles before 7 pm, which is nice when it's $7.75 for a short gin and tonic. There's also no cover, an indication that Sunday nudity lures some guys that are reminiscent of your dad. Expect gentlemen in kahki shorts and button down shirts paying to have a lady rub their bits all over. But at least these gents are better business than the twenty-somethings that just watched the entire time, not a dollar bill in sight. Skeeze. 

It's pretty easy to see which girls are enjoying themselves up there (or at least doing a good job faking it) and who's bored as all get out. We had some very enthusiastic ladies, especially after the shift change at 6pm, and they totally knew how to work the pole in their seven inch heels. Don't come here expecting tig ole fake bitties you usually encounter at Skin or other Scottsdale places. These ladies are au natural and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

What's nicest was this fact that they're willing to sit down and chat with you regardless of whether you're interested in a lap dance or not:
Lovely buxom brunette: ""What are you and your girlfriend celebrating?""
Mr. Man: *baffled, blank stare* ""Sunday?""
LBB: ""Wow! She's a keeper. Hold on to that one!""

Officially out of the dog house.

It's not a brusque, all-business attitude at Bombshells and even though I was the only girl there that wasn't on shift (aside from an awkward couple that came in scowling, stayed for three songs and booked it), there's no awkwardness about it. And since I'm a woman I get the supremely sexy treatment instead of the perfunctory titty shake when I tip.

The icing on our lecherous evening? Mr. Man got a lap dance and the Italian beauty offered to do a couple's one for no extra charge. Now that's class.

Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.

I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.

A strict ""No Cellphones"" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.

That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.

And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.

Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!

Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?

Challenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.

I'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now. 

The other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples. 

Since these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small. 

Several of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails! 

The waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, ""It'll getcha drunk!"" 

The Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour. 

Three dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!",15,10,16
dyhTHLIf6eWBvU78Y3T06A,Erica,rt-EKmn8xpUuWdePYPPcHQ,"""Impact Auto Glass & Tint""",2,12-03-2008,"The word that most aptly describes the Sneaker's experience:

Eww.

This exclamation should be accompanied by a scrunched up nose, sneer or depressed sigh depending on the intonation.

Does the smell of open sewage wafting from the bathrooms entice your tastebuds? Eww! *scrunchy nose*

Do shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*

Does the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*

I live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: ""Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?""

Most frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.

I wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.

That leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. 

It seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.

The service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. 

The decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.

They've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. 

If you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.",10,10,8

Not very comfortable to dine in, but cutesy nonetheless. It also helps that I now work in the surrounding area, since Munch-a-Lunch seems to cater exclusively to the business parks around it. Although it's nothing to write home about, it does a pretty fine job of sating my hunger.

This small hole-in-the-wall joint caters to those on the go with a five dollar sandwich box that consists of a sammich, bag o' chips, candy bar and canned soda. It's a screaming deal compared to most fast food meal deal prices, and you can be in and out in a few minutes. However, if you're willing to wait around a bit (and maybe try out those funky butterfly chairs or watch an old black and white movie on the tele inside), the made to order specials and salads are usually pretty solid and a good bang for your lunch buck. 

One gripe I have with this place is that the consistency is wildly variable depending on the day. I've ordered the Greek salad numerous times (what can I say, I'm a sucker for beets in a salad) and it's been nigh inedible at times due to a heavy hand with the salty dressing and feta cheese. So order dressing on the side if you're a featherweight like me. At times some items have been a bit stale as well. I've had some unfortunate puff pastry that seemed like it had been freezer burned or microwaved a hair too long. And they have a strange propensity for smothering things in sour cream sauce. 

These are little issues in the overall quality of the food though. Sandwiches and salads are always a solid bet, and the Greek menu items have rarely let me down! 

Give it a shot if you're in the area. There's worse things you could do to yourself for five bucks.",3,2,3

There were no belly dancers or tarot card readers, both dinner time lures advertised upon entering, since the noon-to-one crowd is generally geared toward the white collar crowd. That eliminated the possibility of a razzle dazzle performance that may have lured another star out of me, leaving the service, ambiance and food to shine on their own.

The service was adequate. Not really much to say either way on that. I did kind of like the fact that the wait staff was all eating there in a family setting and were just finishing up when I arrived. That immediately raised my expectations, since they wouldn't settle for anything nasty. Also, the kitchen was filled with....Turks! Not a single word of Spanish, which is quite an anomaly in the food service business. Again, my expectations raised.

Upon entering, the customer is given the option of sitting at regular or low seating. I highly recommend the latter, as it consists of plush pillows and short stools arranged around round tables. The main dining area is very open air with warm colors and sparse decorations, but it feels more sterile than the environment created in the adjacent rooms. Within these rooms comfortable open booths and pillows, upholstered in dark, rich colors are accented by decorative lighting that could have been bought from a bazaar and transported straight here. The layout of these side rooms adds to the ambiance and present plenty of opportunity for conversation. 

We all ordered lunch specials, which are composed of rice, pita bread, cabbage slaw and a meat of some sort. The lamb that I ordered was a little on the bland side and stringy. It would have done much better stewed than grilled. I would also highly recommend you trade the plain ole white rice for the biriani rice, which is saffron (turmeric?) based with veggie bits and walnuts. It was savory and scrumptious, the exact opposite of the cabbage slaw, which was an odd combination of vinegar, mint and garlic. It was a little pricey for a lunch special, ringing in at $10.95 without beverages, and the dinner specials are even more expensive.

It is unlikely any of you will find yourself here in the near future and hopefully not even in the far future, as this is where vitality goes to die. But if you find yourself with a flat tire out in the middle of BFE or need to take Grandma out for a night on the town (bedtime by 8pm at the latest, sonny!), this is a pretty respectable choice. And in full confidentiality, it managed to surprise me.
-----------------------------------------------------------

I can't fathom why, but my family resides in the suburban sprawl of Peoria, which happens to border Sun City. I haven't been out to this haven for golf carts and cataracts since I used to live way out in northwest Glendale, but for my stepmother's birthday she wanted to eat at Little Bite of Italy. So we pile in to the car for the mini road trip out there from Tempe.

Having arrived early, Mr. Man and I saunter up to the bar and (gasp!) get carded. Seeing how we were mere babes in the womb compared to some of the patrons there, this was no big surprise. What was surprising was the house sauvignon blanc I ordered that tasted like sweet tarts. And cost a whopping $6.50 for a bitsy little glass. Whatevs. Old people's livers don't work as well as mine, so I can see how they can get away with upping the price.

I was also surprised at this freaky gigantic beer tap that was ordered for the table. It seemed like a little bit of frat boy flava delivered to a demographic that could be their parents or grandparents. It was a wicked cool cylindrical device that held three pitchers and had a chilled center at the base. A gigantic bong of of booze if you will.

Since I'm indecisive I went with the sampler: meat lasagna, chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo. Aside from the fact that it needed salt (again, my blood pressure probably isn't as high as the older folks), the meal was pretty tasty. The alfredo was lackluster, but I've rarely had good alfredo from a restaurant so it was no surprise. I also grazed on a piece of The Works pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushroom, red and green peppers. That was far superior and the left over pizza reheated to a lovely crisp in the oven the next day.

The entertainment was probably the highlight of the evening. There was a 50+ (don't want to offend by guessing wrong), petite female performer in what could have doubled as a figure skating outfit singing her little heart out on stage. She had a great voice, oozed mature sex appeal all over the male customers (no need for viagra that night) and took requests like the pro she was. All ages were shakin' what their momma gave them up in front of the stage, me included, and it was a surprising amount of fun.

I know, why call it a dive if there aren't painted-up hussies propped on bar stools and you're not afraid to contract something lasting from touching the bathroom features? Because it's more like that neglected house down the street owned by the Cat Lady that has chipped paint and an overgrown yard, but when you stop there on Halloween she always has those awesome popcorn balls. Or that ottoman that's a little frayed around the edges and is patched with duct tape to keep the upholstery skirt on, but it's the comfiest damn foot rest. 

Despite the looks, the bar is a local watering hole that attracts your quirky neighbors. Someone brought in the pelt of a javelina they'd shot the day prior to show it off to his buddies. Ever seen one of those ugly things up close? You just might get the chance if you decide to check it out. Chuy's two doors down will serve as a neon-lit mecca for mass consumption, while Baseline Pub will remain the watering hole in the wall that's a little more mellow and a little rougher around the edges.

Happy hour is twelve hours long, from ten to ten, so they don't really have any drink specials, but the prices are cheap so that's not really an issue. Plus there's the requisite pool tables that every good dive has, so you've got something to occupy your time in addition to conversation with the locals.

The down side is that the mixed drinks are a bit on the weak side, so stick with beer. The music selection kind of sucks at times, with either country western or classic rock playing.

Going with the white peach-a-rino, iced pomegrana-rama-ding-dong, the creme brulee-ster, four berries? Berry nice. Makin' the copies...

But I digress.

Tea Infusion has an awesome location in terms of drawing in business, so all you naysayers that are poo pooing its place nestled among chain stores can just shut it. From a business perspective it makes perfect sense. People get thirsty when shopping, especially in the desert, and this place appears like an oasis on the horizon. If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up. So I'd rather laud the smarts of a business man who broke through the corporate mold and managed to offer an independent and hip lil tea shop amid the brand name wasteland that is Tempe Marketplace than complain about it. 

It's so nice to step into this place, breath a sigh of relief and shake off the oppressive crowd of consumers (and anklebiters) waiting just outside that door, especially if it's a weekend evening. And I've got to say that a nice cuppa makes the window shopping, caterwauling live band, and gaggles of giggling adolescents much more enjoyable.

Aside from a tea selection that puts China Mist to shame, they offer some munchitos that I've never indulged in like sandwiches, sides and scrumptious looking desserts. One day, Tea Infusion, one day.

The only complaint I have is with the staff. 

I understand you don't make much and sometimes customers are devilish. I've been a barista before. But that's no excuse to neglect your customers or the cleanliness of your establishment. I went on a Saturday night and one chick was very loudly and obnoxiously chatting up a customer, leaving her coworker to fall behind when handling group after group of people by his lonesome. The counter was filthy and cluttered with tea paraphernalia, smoothie stuff, dirty steeping devices, and milk that someone had neglected to put back in the refrigerator. I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind.

Can ambiance and service compensate for sub par food at ridiculous prices? Oh, the dilemma! I like the beautiful decor and attentive service, but I also like reasonably priced entrees with discernable flavor. Let's see...nope. Well that didn't take very long to decide.

I've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing ""Mongolian Chicken"" or ""BC Hot and Spicy Chicken,"" since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish. 

We started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...

Everything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst:
*Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce.
*Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done.
*Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente. 
*BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had. 
*Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though.
*Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough. 
*Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's. 
*Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.

The side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?

So if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree. 

Maybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.

If you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.",5,4,4

Translation: Let's split the sweet tea, a pile of fried chicken, some waffles, the fried okra, cheesy eggs with onions, a bowl of mac n' cheese and a slice of red velvet cake to go. 

Brimstone was on the air, a haunting violin dirge could be heard wafting through my head, and a sinking feeling settled at the bottom of my gut. We just made a deal with the devil and we didn't even know it. 

That or I was just too hungry to function properly.

But I do know that I would do terrible, devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles. Pawnshops would know me by name and assume I had a hard drug problem, but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!

Perfectly spiced, crisp but not overly battered, moist fried chicken that even Colonel Sanders would sell his soul for, provided he hasn't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance. 

Crunchy, buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup, that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin' Waffle House hockey pucks.

Creamy, cheesy, smooth and decadent mac and cheese. A tribute to the best of Granny's kitchen and an affirmation that Kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity.

And sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good! Or red Kool-aid, lemonade, fountain drinks, or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there.

Almost everything at Lolo's is done well, except for their red velvet cake. It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste (it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor) is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland, meaty red slice. It was a disappointment. 

But on the bright side, maybe this is confirmation that we didn't make a deal with the devil, cuz his cake was weak.",7,11,10

Seriously.

Three of these things will have you giggling, slurring declarations of love to the members of your party, believing your sexiness status just gained +2, craving Jack in the Box tacos and possibly breaking a heel upon your exit.

They are a thing of beauty. (And the reason why they enforce a three margarita limit.)

Unfortunately, they'll run you 6 to 9 bucks depending on how much razzle dazzle you're going for. The Sixth Street Margarita is the most basic, frozen or on the rocks, and is delicious. So is the Z Top Shelf, and the Chambord, and the Frozen Watermelon, and the Grand Marnier, and I think you're sensing the trend here.

And the food... Well, it exists so you don't leave in the condition discussed above. It's not as good as the margaritas, but once you have a couple, you're really not going to care that much.

Brunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulge in a three dollar mimosa, their three dollar top shelf do-it-yourself bloody mary bar (with all the fixins, including beef jerky stir sticks!), or the epic margaritas. The chicken and potato hash is decent, but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had, how do you say, actual flavor. Now it's just blah by comparison. Well done blah. But blah all the same (although Mr. Man loves it). So you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead, both of which are delicious. 

Happy hour is also a pretty good deal, with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers. I'd recommend the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings that are like crispy round Asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin' in sweet chile sauce or the Tortilla Soup, which is done really, really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken. 

But forget the food. It's the backup vocals to the wailing showboat sex symbol of a lead singer that runs back stage for a mid show sex\/drug\/booze binge while his second tier stand-in entertains the crowd with a limp solo. 

The margaritas are bad ass and they know it. Let 'em get a little saucy with ya.

Probably because I grew up in Glendale, which is filled with boring suburbs of cookie cutter homes surrounded by six foot concrete security gates that house dysfunctional 2.5 kiddo families and promote a sense of community as deep as a valley girl's vocabulary.

So any time we visited cutesy pootsy downtown Glendale it was a memorable experience.

I've toured the factory multiple times and regardless of age, childlike glee paints the face of every person in the tour group. You'll be thrilled by chocolate rivers, marshmallow clouds, edible buttercups and small orange creatures with violent green hair and a penchant for bursting into songs that have afterschool special messages tacked onto the end. Well not really, but it's as close to Willy Wonka as you're getting here in the Valley.

Free tours on the half hour and sampling to your heart's content! Try the rectangular green ones. They're mint truffles and arguably the best I've had. Eat it Andes!! But I'm biased. I grew up with Cerreta. I stole their individually wrapped chocolates from the bins at Bashas. I went to high school with their daughter Candy--who's as sweet as her namesake. I'm a die hard fan of these home grown chocolatiers, and there isn't any other place I'd rather go to rekindle a bit of childhood nostalgia.

It's good family fun, a great date idea, or a nice distraction for the babysitters\/aunties\/grandmas out there (cuz you'll want to give the kids back right after they o'd on sugar).

I think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them, and tomato sauce hurts when it ends up in your eye. But in twenty-odd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland noodles and into the realm of big girl flavors. I think that's why I was so disappointed by Giuseppe's. 

I ordered the smoked salmon with asparagus pasta, thinking, ""Heck yeah, lox me up and throw away the key!"" Instead, I got the toddler special in disguise, a big pile of noodles drowning in butter, with flakes of salmon and asparagus floating throughout. Ewwie. The noodles were freshly prepared since it was the weekend and were a doughy delight. It's too bad they were marred by such a crap combination. I mean, you can't even toss in some garlic, onions or something vaguely resembling seasoning? Failure, failure, failure.

My boyfriend's pasta carbonara was a thing of beauty. It is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley. Most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night. Very few take the time to saute onions, garlic and pancetta, add steaming hot pasta, raw egg and parmesan cheese and toss until it oozes together into drool inducing blob of yum. Amazing good. 

It's just odd that such contradictory dishes are on the same menu. 

We also had the garlic bread, because what better to add to a giant pile of carbs than more bread? It was passable. Very dry and crispy, more like crouton, and topped with a delish garlicky spice infused oil. Four tiny toastettes for four bucks though. Not the greatest deal. 

I shall be back. I'll just stay far, far away from the noodly combos of questionable origin.

It's really the texture that's more up for debate. Melty gelatinous gummy balls that are sproingy on the teeth is one way to describe it. Black phlegmatic chunks of mucous laden smokers lung is another. It's all about perspective.

I happen to like the gooey little pearls that collect at the bottom of milky green tea, and Eba Cafe is the best place in the valley to indulge. They used to be located just north of ASU and I would pop in before classes, until one day they vanished without a trace. I was adrift without my convenient bubbly study break fare, but as fate would have it, I was stuck in gridlock on Broadway and what should mine eyes behold? A bright red ""Eba"" in a strip mall across from the dairy plant. 

What a sweet reunion it was! Jelly goodness afloat in milky green or black tea with one of thirty-some possible flavors added!
 
The black and green tea are traditional stand-bys, but if you're feeling daring, try the wintermelon tea. It has no sugar added but the natural sugar is so incredibly potent that I couldn't finish a thimble full sample without experiencing the puckered, day-uuum-that's-sweet face. After you've chosen your tea, try to narrow down the flavor additives, red bean is a solid choice but watermelon is my ultimate trump card. Mango, taro and honeydew are also pretty tasty. Then decide if you want some kind of gelatinous goop added to your drink. They have several different types including boba and coffee jellies, which I've heard are great in, well, coffee drinks.

Eba also has some light lunch and munch options if you feel like nibbling. I've had the green curry chicken bowl, which is earthy with a nice spice, but the accompanying rice was a little dried out. If you're just there for a snack, try the brick toast with coconut. Delish! They also serve gelato, but between you and me, it looked kinda nast. Eba should just stick with what it does best, wicked good tea with lovely little snot balls.",7,5,3

Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger, fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes. 

Granted the burger is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.

I do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger, for the wimps like me out there. Regardless, I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place, because they're seriously too good to get away. 

The french fries are also in the style that I like, freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.

I also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there, but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly, that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it.

The little parking lot in a strip mall off Apache was bustling with activity, so I hoped we would be able to score a table easier than we had tried for a parking spot. I don't like waiting for the first meal of the day. I turn into the reckapotamus from Hell, whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld. 

But there wasn't a soul to be found enjoying a Tasty Kabob...it was a strange Twilight Zone of inactivity. Everyone and their mother was next door at Pita Jungle, but just because there are a lot of people there doesn't mean it's any good, just that they prefer to flock toward mediocrity, like sheep, or lemmings.

Halfway through the meal, I was thinking about flocking too. 

Although the hummus came with olives, chopped tomatoes and herbs, it was a bit bland overall. The pitas were warm and delicious though, and the combination of hummus and flat bread helped keep the reckapotamus banished to the depths. It was a generous portion for two, but I found myself munching on it just to pass the time until our lunches came, not because it was exceptionally well done.

So I wasn't ravenous when my meal arrived, but I was certainly looking forward to some good eats. Alas, the chicken schwarma pita sandwich delivered the same mediocre impression. The chicken was overly dry and not well seasoned, and again, the pita was the star of the dish. 

I didn't have the Persian ice cream this time, but I have in the past. It's fairly cheap and delicious, so if any of you out there are interested in trying a flavor that's certainly not of the 31 at Baskin Robbins, give it a whirl. I'm considering giving this place another star based on the ice cream alone...but I can't bring myself to. So consider it a 3.5 star experience overall.

I'm just glad the prices were reasonable for lunch, six or seven bucks for a sandwich. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit cheated. The ambiance was lacking as well, with generic cafeteria type seating (as stated before), and the service as attentive but awkward since we were the only people in there, so that leaves the food alone to shine.

It was the Hawaiian pulled pork hash that was a total bummer on the plate. The hashbrowns were practically black in some places and mushy in others, and the pulled pork was a mass of dry, bland shredded meat. To top it off, the eggs were done over hard with no runny yolk goodness. Suck.

Now I have to admit that at first introduction many years ago I would have rated this place no higher than two stars. The service was spotty (as has been mentioned before) with a couple folks doing quadruple duty as wait staff, busser, host(ess), and cashier.

All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.

Well played.

I wish I could say the same about Fate.

My dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. 

We didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, ""Fate."" 

I really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. 

After entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.

The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. 

After paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.

They were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. 

It tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, ""I'm never coming back here again."" To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.

Fate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review.

I used to go there all the time in the first year or so it was opened, but since then their standards for the serving staff have seriously gone down hill.

I'm a pretty patient person when it comes to servers, but the last few times I've gone, I've had to track someone down to get service at our bay.

Let's just take last night for example:
My friends and I were for more than 15 minutes before someone finally came to the table to just say hello and take drink orders. Luckily, in that time we'd decided on food, otherwise who knows how long it would have been before we could have ordered.
We had eaten most of our food and had a refill of chips on the way (thanks to a food runner) before our server brought out my friend's drink.
She'd forgotten it was at the bar, and instead of having a new one made, she'd brought the drink to the table with almost all the ice melted. We had to track her down again so we could ask to get a new one made.
We saw food runners and bussers more than twice the number of times we saw our actual server the whole night and the place was not busy at all.

On top of the less than stellar service, the food is overpriced for what you get. While yes, some of it is excellent and the concepts are interesting, most is mediocre at best.

Recommendation:
If you do go there, choose earlier in the day when you'll spend less on game play. The savings at that time might at least be worth what you pay for overall experience.",0,0,1

They got a factory rim and a new tire the following day. It could have been same day but the I had miss there delivery from the dealership. 

I took it to get it aligned across the street and they said they did the best they could. They're best was well really bad the stirring wheel if you hold it straight the truck would go straight but if you left go the house whole truck went to the left. 

Discount Tire told me they recommend going to Quality Star down rancho. we brought it to them. Later that day they said it would be bout 500 for a control arm thats cracked. But it's still pulling so they need to work on it. Later that same day they called and said it would be another hundred and something for another part. they were really sorry but they are trying to fix it but they keep find problems.  We went down to pay and see it is was down. when we got there they were test driving it. but told me the bill was now eight hundred and something. I was annoyed but just wanted my truck fixed. however when they were done with the test drive he said it's better but not perfect and ask for more time. we let them keep it a few more days but  when we would call for updates it was just a run around. 
I had a gut feeling something was wrong so we went down and said we just want the truck back. they gave us a speech about how it's a process and we should turn it into insurance because the whole front end on the passenger side needs to be replaced. I said hell no and took my truck home on the way I noticed if you hold the wheel level it now went to the left and it you let go it quick pulled to the right. so I had to fight to keep it straight. I also notice when I got home they banged my drive side door frame so I am missing paint along the door

we called a relative worried bout the truck and not sure where to go or what to do. 
He told me to take it to Arrow Alignment and they would take a look. He sends all his customers there that have issues  with there alignments. 
We made an appointment and took it in this morning. They are pretty far from me. the Mechanic talked to us for a few minutes and asked for some background about the problem. 
he said the give him about an hour. 
I went back to work fearing another big bill. but thankfully that didn't happen. I went down and he said he fixed it. that it was the alignment and also the wheel as it had worn wrong because of how I had been having to drive it.

That of course means I need supplys, as my other dog ""Luna"" has her own beds and kennel. While I was walking around an employee who we believe was a supervisor approached us and ask if we needed help. She then went on to explain about this puppy coupon book. It was 19.99 and it gave you a discount on a kennel mat, which she said even though it said Kong mats they could use it for any of them. Then there was a discount on food bowls, she again said any kind. Discount on treats and food. Lastly there were so great discounts on training. Classes, doggie daycare etc. So we're thinking great this will help a lot. 

The kennels were pretty expensive, they have one thats a camping kennel. It's great as the dog gets old as she's a small breed and will me sleeping in it next to my bed. It was 59.99 but the one I purchased for my other dog at another business was 25. 

The bowl selection was okay, they was a lot of glass and plastic ones. I preffer the stainless steel. I found a nice one for a fair price. 

Food is the reason I come here. They have a great selection and hills makes a food Luna loves so we grabbed there puppy food and I though it was a good price at 15.00.

We tried to explain that we picked items that an employee directed us to. She just said ""well who told you that, what's there name what do the look like."" Lucky enough the supervisor walked by and the cashier didn't bother to ask her what she told us.  So we were just not going to get the coupon book. Then the camping kennel rang up as .01 so the second cashier said they cannot sale it. I told her you have it on the shelf with a price and item I'd number on the shelf that matches the item, what do you mean I cannot buy it. She said they .01 means they don't carry the item anymore and cannot sale it. It means they used to carry it. It's a kong brand that they have a large selection of sizes. They had 12 or more of varying sizes. Her logic blew my mind, ""we used to carry it"" hello I have the item in my hand so you clearly still do. They did not bother to ask a manager. Also we were not asking for a discount. So petsmart would have made 200.00 but instead I left everything and went to a cheaper competitor and got the same bed for half.

It's frustrating to me as I am not a novice to buying cars I have bought and sold 50 plus cars. So I did my research and math before I came here. I knew what the trade value was on my truck, but of course the dealership says they don't use blue book, black book, edmonds or nada which is fine I don't expect full trade value but they came in 5 k less. When I told the sales me what another dealership offered he told me to go there. So I did and bought an Xj from them and sold my truck. 

However, there was an issue with the seat heater. For some reason, it only worked when the car was in park. No worry's I took it to this dealership's service department as it had factory warranty on it and was covered. I explained the problem and left my car. The service rep was very nice and helpful, made me feel very welcomed and valued, unlike the sales person. 

They called me a few days later saying there's no issue with the heater and I can come get it. They said they turned the car on and tested it with a thermometer and it heats up fine. I told them that I know it works with the car is in park, but I don't drive around in park. So I asked them to read the notices that the service rep made when I explained how to recreate the issue and call me when its fixed.

a few months ago I slammed.my truck into a curb. I destroyed the wheel and rim. took the truck to Discount tire to get replacements, which they were able to do. They got a factory rim and a new tire the following day. It could have been same day but the I had miss there delivery from the dealership. 

I took it to get it aligned across the street and they said they did the best they could. They're best was well really bad the stirring wheel if you hold it straight the truck would go straight but if you left go the house whole truck went to the left. 

Discount Tire told me they recommend going to Quality Star down rancho. we brought it to them. Later that day they said it would be bout 500 for a control arm thats cracked. But it's still pulling so they need to work on it. Later that same day they called and said it would be another hundred and something for another part. they were really sorry but they are trying to fix it but they keep find problems.  We went down to pay and see it is was down. when we got there they were test driving it. but told me the bill was now eight hundred and something. I was annoyed but just wanted my truck fixed. however when they were done with the test drive he said it's better but not perfect and ask for more time. we let them keep it a few more days but  when we would call for updates it was just a run around. 
I had a gut feeling something was wrong so we went down and said we just want the truck back. they gave us a speech about how it's a process and we should turn it into insurance because the whole front end on the passenger side needs to be replaced. I said hell no and took my truck home on the way I noticed if you hold the wheel level it now went to the left and it you let go it quick pulled to the right. so I had to fight to keep it straight. I also notice when I got home they banged my drive side door frame so I am missing paint along the door

we called a relative worried bout the truck and not sure where to go or what to do. 
He told me to take it to Arrow Alignment and they would take a look. He sends all his customers there that have issues  with there alignments. 
We made an appointment and took it in this morning. They are pretty far from me. the Mechanic talked to us for a few minutes and asked for some background about the problem. 
he said the give him about an hour. 
I went back to work fearing another big bill. but thankfully that didn't happen. I went down and he said he fixed it. that it was the alignment and also the wheel as it had worn wrong because of how I had been having to drive it.

I also can't thank them enough for seeing the potential in the old Taco Cabana (and for keeping their bathroom signs - it's a riot!!).

The place has such a nice vibe to it, and the attention to detail can really be seen in the well designed menu, the space and the staff. The tables are all branded with the circle h logo, which is actually a brand once used on a family farm. Pictures of the family hang on the walls to admire as you wander about the space and there is a lot of room to socialize and enjoy some great barbecue.

I've been waiting ages for this place to open, and upon hearing of their first official day of their soft opening (grand opening coming in a month or so), I was able to convince a few friends to swing in to grab some dinner. While everything on the menu wasn't there, most of it was. Well, aside from the Dr. Pepper cake which I am now dying to try. The menu consists of appetizers, some common, some uncommon, like the grilled cheese sandwich trio I think will be a frequent meal and the gringo nachos. Salads are available as well as sandwiches, platters and huge combo meals that will probably cover a family for a decent price. 

I had the brisket sandwich, and the others in my party had the Memphis Flyer (pulled pork + slaw). The food came quickly in a basket with the typical red and white checkered paper. Mine came with the sauce on the side, which is homemade. While the brisket needed no sauce, it was too good to resist and I loaded it on. The bun never got too soggy and hard to manage and the barbecue was amazing. It was enough for a meal too without feeling too full. 

They are still in the process of opening, and as such all the decorations aren't yet up and the bar is not available quite yet, but this should not keep you from trying it out soon. The patio is gorgeous, the people are great, and it's another great reuse of space by a great local business owner.

I ordered the pear panini and an orange mojito. The pear panini was extremely delicious. There have been a few occasions since where I've thought of trying to imitate it at home. My orange mojito didn't taste very orange but in the end it wasn't worth asking for another one with the speed of service.

It happened to be perfect earlier this week for dinner with a friend after I was picked up from the airport. 

The food description Matt C. described is accurate so I'll elaborate on other points. The menu, which we both took pictures of once we saw Goat Curry listed, is small and interesting. It leaves me wanting to come back, and yes, next time, I will be getting the goat curry. I'm sure you are all lining up to come with for my 2nd visit now. 

I had the jerk chicken with rice, plantains, and a side of vegetable (I had two to choose from - steamed eggplant or bok choy). It was very delicious. The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful, and wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken, which had some decent spice to it, actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember. 

The plantains, oh the sweet plantains were PHE NOM IN AL!!!!!! Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?

To drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious. And, well, the name itself makes it worthy.

Overall, this place was reasonably priced, and allowed us to enjoy our meal slowly, and talk for hours afterwards. The staff is truly genuine. If you're in the area, I'd definitely stop here.

I had only been there for drinks a couple times, and loved the bar area, so I figured it would be nice to come back and try some dinner.

One thing that amazes me about this area is how there are always so many cars parked along the road, yet no one is ever in any of the establishments (aside from Fair Trade). Luckily there is the slightly hidden parking deck so we were able to find a spot there. We got there right on time for our reservation. It was very empty when we got there yet it took a good 15 minutes to be seated. I can't say the dining service here is very efficient.

However, there are so many things on their menu I want to try that I can see myself coming back a few times. I started off sharing the scallop appetizer with the butternut squash with a friend and it was so good. The butternut squash was PERFECT and the scallops were mouth watering.

My main dish was the pork with the bourbon apple glaze and the au gratin potatoes and vegetables (I feel horrible that I forget the name). It was just the right amount of food and absolutely delicious. The au gratin potatoes were fabulous and the glaze on that pork was to die for. It had huge apple chunks with it too and omg... so delicious. The vegetables were carrots and two spears of asparagus and I have to admit they weren't the best.

Ready?

Caffe Boa's brunch is the best in Phoenix. Hands down. I'm also making this claim without having ever been past the patio. If you don't believe me, check out the amazing photos I added.

The patio is so gorgeous and serene you don't even realize you're right down smack dab in the middle of college central. The vines growing along the side and the umbrellas suspended from the roof are simply magnificent. The place settings are beautiful, and listening to the birds tweet as they hop around all while a great breeze blows makes it instantly calming enough to warrant going by yourself, serene enough for talking business, and sexy enough for a date. 

The staff is phenomenal, and our server, Bri, was just the best ever. She helped me through some very tough Sunday morning meal decisions as well as explained all about Caffe Boa and how many of their items on their dinner and new brunch menu are made from scratch, organic, and\/or locally grown. The brunch menu also has only been around a few weeks. I'm glad that I stopped by before word spreads.

I started off with the white sangria, which wasn't sold by the glass until brunch. Additionally, during brunch, the pitchers of sangria are half off. The glass was huge and full of flavor and goodness. It was filled with apples, grapes, oranges, and cherries and was absolutely delightful. After the sangria, I had to try the mimosa, and I was not disappointed. Mimosas, Bellini, and champagne are 8 per glass or 18 bottomless at brunch. And yes, you can mix and match them. It may sound a little pricey, but they would kick the ass of the 2 dollar mimosas many places have. Total weaklings they are compared to this masterpiece.

After going round and round on just what I wanted to order, I settled on the eggs benedict which had prosciutto, poached eggs, and basil hollandaise over an English muffin. On the side was an amazing goat cheese and tomato (though I did without tomato). I added some cracked pepper and unbleached wine rock salt. Decadent. Simply exquisite. I don't typically care for salt and I couldn't help but keep putting a tiny pinch on my meal. 

The service was just the right speed for a brunch, not too fast and not too slow. I don't like to be rushed on a Sunday morning. I was able to enjoy myself and take in the amazing food I was eating as well as enjoy the scenery, which made me believe I really had been transported to a gorgeous countryside when I walked in the door. 

I will gladly come here again for brunch, and despite my typical dislike of pasta, the description Bri gave us, has me craving that as well.

I'm sure I don't have to mention that this is indeed one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches I've ever had, and the same is probably true for most. It's messy. It's spicy. It's hot. It's goodness. The perfect amount of flavor and kick and enough to make you just full enough. 

Oh? You need more proof? The waffle fries are out of this world. Waffle fries are one of my favorites in the fry family and the ones at AZ88 do not disappoint. Not too undercooked. Not burnt. Just right. They'll also help take the edge off the sandwich for those of you that could use that.

I've also really enjoyed the picnic chicken sandwich, which is enough to feet multiple people for a picnic. The sandwich is light and summery and there's lots of yummy fruit on the side. I feel like I should be in one of those hidden valley ranch commercials out on the rolling hills with the trees when I'm eating it.

The service is pretty average but nothing extraordinary. The place is swanky though and the bar is fully stocked. With reasonable prices, great food and swanky decor, this is an all around win if you are looking to impress.. others or just yourself!!",2,1,0

I'm pretty particular and careful about the care of my car. So much so, that in the past, unless I need it waxed or detailed, I usually washed and vacuumed myself. 

Now, I find myself still sneaking in for a little TLC at Los Olivos though, when I am too lazy to do it myself. The staff is super nice and very helpful with letting you know about what they offer and any specials without being pushy in any way. They even have a punch card and eventually you get a free wash. Pretty dandy eh? 

The waiting area isn't top notch, but it's a car wash people. It does have a small shop with sodas, snacks, gift cards, random misc car items and some chairs to sit and wait. Supposedly there's a shoe shiner, but I'm still waiting for the day we're there at the same time. Additionally, Giant Coffee is just a hop, skip and a jump away, and that's usually where I am while I wait.

I've been a loyal customer for awhile now, and this past weekend, realized it was time to get the interior of the car detailed again. They did a spectacular job which prompted my need to review. I ordered the mini detail which does a full job inside and a wash and buff\/wax outside. The four hours was so worth it. They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe. Ever since, I've been showing her off, and it feels like I'm in a brand new car all over again. The paint is shiny and new, the inside was cleaned from top to bottom (even the ceilings) and the detail in the dashboard and console is incredible. I had already decided to never go anywhere else, but now I think I'll be getting it detailed much more often.

As a child, that's where we always had a membership. A YMCA is where I took swim lessons, where I learned I am not good at indoor soccer, even if it does involve cute jr high boys, and where my dad took me with him to use the real gym for the first time. There's something about YMCAs that make you feel like home, and the Chris-Town YMCA is no different. 

The staff, first and foremost, is very friendly. From my first visit to every one after, they've always been kind and answered any questions I have had, no matter how silly. 

The instructors are the same way. I took my first ever spin class here, and I didn't feel like an idiot when I wasn't sure how the hell to set that bike up. And no one judged me for the sad looks on my face when any gear above 14 was mentioned. Oh. And the bike class was outside that morning. Awesome!! The zumba class on Thursday nights is a great mix of different types of people at all different skill levels. And the studio it's in is gorgeous. 

So speaking of gorgeous, that's what this place is. The colors on the outside and inside within the studio and the entry walls are so bright and colorful. It makes you want to get moving. The studio where zumba and other classes are held is amazing. The bright paint, the new floors and the windows looking outside can't be very old. There is a brand new gym with a basketball court that is phenomenal.  

Standard gym equipment applies, but is very well kept. After a few weeks, I have still yet to see one that is out of order. The gym area is packed with treadmills, ellipticals,standard weight machines and free weights also, and always seems to be packed. That is the one slight downfall. Sometimes you will have to wait if you want to use a treadmill or elliptical. However, I've never had to wait long and come on, pick up a pair of weights or something. Or use the amazing rock climbing treadmill wall thing they have. This YMCA also has the fitlinxx system that lets you keep track of your progress. Way to go!!

The only downfall so far, is that they haven't had an operational membership card machine since before I started. Therefore, I still have yet to get my membership card which makes it not feel as real. I'm sure the minute I come in with the most terrible workout getup known to mankind, it will magically be fixed.

The only problem was, everything I thought of, I didn't think I'd want years down the road. I love accessories, but I'm pretty picky about anything permanent. Last year, I finally decided, and had a friend draw up some sketches around my idea. The result was something I couldn't *not* get inked. And when I started asking around, everyone pointed me to Heather at Lady Luck. 

Heather has a quaint little shop in Braggs Pie Factory. Heather has a pink glittery art piece of a unicorn. I was in love with it. She was in love with my tattoo. It was a match made in heaven. 

I worked with Heather for about 4 months before the big day. I showed her my sketch. We discussed the procedure and prices. I had the sketch stenciled on me in at least two different places so I could try out places before the day came. I called her. I emailed her. I asked her a million paranoid questions. I was sure she'd be annoyed with me by the time the day came. 

I went in, and Heather had a TV set up for while I was there and a stand that I could easily set my water and phone on. I brought a few movies of my own and my ipod, but I didn't even use them. We ended up watching one of her movie and laughing and talking about it the whole time. She finished the piece in nearly no time at all, which pretty much takes up the front part of the top of my left arm, but is only in black and white in a little over an hour. And only the bottom of Dot's dress hurt, and even that pain was tolerable. I was surprised. I had completely planned on freaking out and ending up with a toe or something and that's it. Instead, I walked out with the most gorgeous thing I could imagine, an appointment for a tiny touch up a few months later, and great instructions on how to care for it. 

And still I called a few more times, unsure if what I was experiencing was normal. And no one yelled at me or became annoyed (at least to my face). And the touchup was free. 

Here I am about 8 months later, with a tattoo that to this day, gets way too much attention. But hey, that's part of the reason you get one right? Everyone loves Dot. And I love telling the story of how quick and painless it was and referring everyone that wants a great inking experience to head to Heather.

However, by the time my friends and I got around to eating and stopped chatting, we knew there would be a long line at Los Dos, so we swung by Aunt Chiladas. While it was good, it wasn't fantastic, and I'm not sure I'd do it again.

The first foul was getting there and not realizing the entire front area was a bar\/bar seating and not places you can order food (speaking of which, why can't you order food at the bar... ugh). We were then thrown with a 50 minute wait for what seemed like a practically empty parking lot. As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing. 

After we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion. Interestingly enough when our food came, our waitress brought it out and then just walked away leaving it on the fold out serving tray and not delivering it to our table. The tacos a friend ordered were taunting him horrendously. Mine came with the wrong side dish which meant I had to constantly push it out of the way.

Not much my friends. Not much. I haven't bowled much in AZ so I wasn't really sure what to expect, and I have to admit, that there were some major differences from when I bowl with my family elsewhere. 

The biggest? The bowling balls were behind the counter. Is this normal in AZ? I understand people seem to love to steal the shoes, but do people really try to steal bowling balls? It totally sucked to have to go to the counter to test out bowling balls between frames to find a good weight.

They kind of made up for this by having PBR on tap, but were brought back down again by not having the ginger in the Jameson & Ginger as advertised. Upon asking, they made a ginger ale (the coke crap) and well I really wanted some so it was acceptable. I remember my quote being, ""This isn't bad for a fake ginger ale & Jameson."" I'm not quite sure if I liked that they came and got my order at the lanes or not. They were pretty insistent on me not heading to the bar to order my drink, even though I had no clue what they had, so I needed to scope it out. If you want to server people, that's fantastic. Really. I'm a fan. But have the menu by the lanes.

All in all the lanes were easy to use and we didn't have too many issues we needed assistance with other than a bowling ball that kept getting stuck in the return. A total of maybe 6 times. In 2 games. Bonus for being able to customize your ""theme."" Anti-bonus for the crappy ads to the left when no one's playing beside you. The only food that looked good on that screen was the chocolate chip cookies. And those guys that are advertising bowling safety, do not look like bowlers. 

We paid for our shoes up front and the games when we finished. It was pretty easy and the rates weren't that bad in my opinion. Sounds like this may become an occasional thing, though in which case, I'll have to up my game. The boys all crushed my so-called bowling skills.",1,0,1

My wasabi pork dumplings ended up being consumed by one of the other members of my party and my ginger pork salad mostly consumed by me. They were two items I had never had before and I have to admit I was somewhat a happy camper, but not quite what I was expecting them to taste like either. I can say though that was the first time I ever had just an okay food experience at Sens. The sugar cane is fabulous and the miso is some of the best ever. 

They may be small plates, but they are filling and reasonably priced in my opinion. 

The cucumber water? Fantastic and refreshing. If you are craving sake, go for the chilled lemongrass. However, remember it's potent and potentially can be a weapon that ruins your night.

The DJ we had last night as we sat down was truly phenomenal and I wish he would've stayed the entire night. He played the type of music that is appropriate for Sens. Instrumental, mix of upbeat and slow but all with some ambiance. It made you want to strike up a quiet conversation and just take in the atmosphere, which is decadent. After awhile though the DJ switched and the new one was playing a mixture of good songs, but nothing appropriate for Sens.

The evening was supposed to start out with a trip to BW3s in Mesa (Buffalo Wild Wings for you non midwesterners). However, due to a special event we had to make a last minute decision to head to Famous Daves. At first we were told there would be an hour wait, which was sad. No more than 5 minutes after we seated ourselves at the bar though, our table was ready!! Success!!

Our server was pretty polite and I appreciated his razzing me for only having water (I had already downed 10 cocktails earlier that day) and was very good with taking our orders and the quirky ways we wanted to change things. Our food came out fast and prompt and everyone seemed very pleased with the change in venue. 

Some things that put them above being a typical barbecue chain?

** At one point someone at the table was telling a story and the pig decided to sit down at the fireplace behind her and imitate her for about 5 minutes before she noticed. It was HILAROUS. You creeped me out at first pig, but I heart you now.

** Dynamite looking sparklers on free birthday treats??? ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. We were all jealous of that dessert.

Delux was one of the first restaurants I went to upon moving to Phoenix and I have gone back a few times since, mainly at lunch during the work week. It's my favorite burger spot. 

The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.

The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce. 

Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also. 

I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.

We have courted on several occasions. At first I thought maybe we were destined to be casual flings forever. I loved your eclectic style mixed with your sensuality. I've always loved that you filled your delicious martinis to the brim, but in the back of my head thought you were always just trying to get me drunk. Your menu begs me to keep coming back for more whenever I get the chance.

However, you went above and beyond the other night, and it's all thanks to your delightful server Candace. She is a diamond in the rough and needs to be given a handsome bonus or raise. Do not reward her with vacation though, as I expect her schedule to follow my FEZ cravings from here on out :)

From the get go, my crew of out of towners were suspicious they would not receive their food in time to enjoy it, not be rushed, and be able to make their flights back home. I was selfish and wanted to show them the best restaurant not in walking distance from the hotel and bussed them on the light rail to FEZ.

We informed the staff of our situation and apologized in advance. And we experienced the best service I have ever had probably anywhere in the valley. Our waters were delivered promptly (but without bendie straws.. slight sad face) and we ordered immediately after. Candace never minded repeating the drink menu items as we didn't have but one of those menus on the table for all 10 of us. 

Our food came out quickly and all at the same time. Drinks were delivered with flair. Everyone spent the first few minutes moaning in happiness. Following it were a few moments of extreme gratitude for the delicious food and then a lot more silence as we devoured our meals without feeling like we were in a hurry any longer. 

The bills were brought out.. separate... to everyone right as some of us were about finished and needed to start thinking about a ride to the airport. It was beautiful. Despite gratuity being included, I believe we all included extra because we truly appreciated our service and meals that night.

In fact, I can never finish my fries and FEZ burger so I had half sitting there and one of my friends asked if they could have some of it as it was so delicious the first time he had it.

Additionally, while this locale does take plastic rather than just cash, and even tho it divides up the bill when you look at it by seat, you cannot split the bill more then 2 ways. This will repeatedly cause an issue for my coworkers. Might as well only take cash.

A spinach\/cucumber dip with naan. The dip was fairly delicious but I didn't get to enjoy much of it due to the naan being hard, almost to the point of being stale. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Does it not travel well? 

The spicy chicken dish with vegetables and Persian rice with spices and raisins was just meh. Nothing like the dish I was expecting. The rice was the part I was anticipating most, and the part the gave me the most disappointment.

5V8eXkTJb6IejJkMDaj_Bw,Tonia,Gxu3_yzEAXKtkBB0YpnvlQ,"""Sally Beauty Supply""",1,19-07-2009,"Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)",6,3,3

I'd like to start off by saying that I was expecting to give Mabel Murphys a 5 star review as the best place to watch a Green Bay game in the Valley, possibly all of the southwest after going there for Packers\/Vikings game yesterday.

However, I never saw the game there, and therefore, can't say that.

For anyone that's a Packers fan that hails from Wisconsin, you should have a picture in your mind of the classic Wisconsin sports bar - Packers memorabilia EVERYWHERE, Leinenkugels aplenty, cheese curds on the menu, that surprisingly homey feel, lots of screaming and fanaticism.

Typically this is Mabel Murphys. My first visit there was for the Bears\/Packers Monday night game last year and it was complete mayhem, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. The typical ""fight songs"" played at Lambeau are played during commercial breaks and screamed by the fans. You can't find anyone in there not sporting their green and gold and it's hard to find a seat or standing spot unless you are there an hour or more ahead of time. It screams home for all of us that left the frozen tundra.

However, I think one hazardous flaw was made this year. They closed for renovation and nothing on their website hinted at anything of the sort. Therefore, people that don't head to Old Town all the time and come those few times a year for the games where being with your own kind is of importance had no idea unless they would've tried to call, and who calls to make sure a Packers bar is open the night they play the Vikings with Favre adorned in purple? Nevertheless, I arrived an hour before the game to find out they weren't open an that nearly a dozen people also did not get the memo. The construction worker there had no suggestions of where to go and there was no note on the door from management. They said they had been having people stop by all day asking, and had no suggestions.

I missed pre game due to having to drive to another bar. Mabel Murphys really disappointed me last night. I really hope they can make up for it. Never get on the bad side of a Packer fan and never deny them of their game. I've never been more sad about a Yelp review than now.",3,0,1

The air was indeed fresh, and the food was delicious. I really loved the laid back atmosphere that we had during lunchtime. And there's definitely something fun about the entrance from the parking lot. 

The menu looked delicious and the idea of items small enough that I can try more than one always makes the indecisive crazy in my happy and quiet. We started with the tots as a starter and chipotle aioli. Presentation is pretty top notch at Stax. I loved that little fryer basket. Reminded me of the little shopping cart at Delux. Love :)

They came exactly as I ordered and were wonderful. I honestly can't tell you which one I liked more; they were both fantastic in their own special unique way.

I have only had one day at the gym so far, but was so impressed by what I saw, encountered, and learned that I needed to tell my story. 

Saturday I headed there to make use of the personal training that was available to me for the weight loss competition Gangplank is putting on. I have my own gym, and I love going there for the dance classes, but I figured a personal trainer couldn't hurt. I'd had one before at a previous gym and it was great. 

I arrived not really knowing what to expect other than I was going to have a person assessment done that would then be used as a periodic benchmark to measure my progress. 

Competitive Fitness is a small gym with a big personality. They strive to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle, not to make people lose a million pounds. There are only two types of machines available - the treadmill which is used for warming up and the rowing machines. Most of the exercises done are based on movements the body does naturally.

I was greeted almost immediately upon entering and was brought to a treadmill to warm up while one of the trainers, Sally, went over what I would be doing that day and how the gym works. About halfway into it, I met with Jason, who was going to be going through my assessment with me. I think I gained more knowledge about fitness during this visit than I ever had in my entire life. I also learned I did not know how to use a rowing machine and I am way more coordinated when I'm dancing. 

Then it was time to do my assessment. It was so intense that I was a little light headed and needed a million gallons of water when I was done. Later that day I felt it in my legs (and still do today). It was also only 7 minutes. It felt like forever and throughout the entire thing, everyone else in the gym that was working out or hanging around was cheering me on. It was so incredible. I've never felt that level of community and enthusiasm in a gym and it really does help. 

Tomorrow I will start my regular training. Each day there is a set routine or list of exercises everyone that stops in performs. A trainer is there to walk through the proper way to do the exercises and to help along the way. They are also timing you. At the end your time is posted on the board. This not only helps track progress but creates that competitive environment that really does help regardless of what people say. 

It's a great way to think about training and fitness and I'm looking forward to the next few weeks here. Depending on how this goes, I am looking to switch from my current gym to this one when my membership runs out. If I could pay for two at one time, I might consider doing it sooner.",1,0,0

The inside of the bowling alley surprised me and made me smile. The tables were actually exquisite. Yes I also used the word exquisite in regards to bowling alley decor. The bar was gorgeous too. The animations and clips between frames and so forth were a little odd and unexpected but pretty hysterical. I loved the murals on the sides of the lanes that worked perfectly with the cosmic bowling lighting as well as the mural on the back wall near the bar that showed a tale of bowling long ago.

Some of the set up of the alley was awkward, such as the huge tables being out of reach from the bowling area and therefore are probably only used in leagues. The bowling area seating wasn't anywhere near as exquisite and had no place to put your drink but on top of the bowling ball shelf. 

The music was hopping though the transitions between the songs could've been better and some of the songs were repeated. However, the birthday medley that was played in my honor was an amazing mix.

From the minute we arrived we were welcomed. It was nice. My friend's dog was given a bone to enjoy while he sat outside. Definite bonus points there. We were each given a couple cups to sample some flavors first. I was pondering the base of my creation... snickerdoodle or pineapple. Both were excellent. I finally decided on Snickerdoodle mixed with cake batter, thinking it would be a good combo. I also added some almonds and reese's peanut butter cup.

I was shocked at how low the price was and how delicious it tasted. The cake batter was okay and the snickerdoodle was phenomenal. However, next time I think I need to add more almond.

The decor is EFFING ADORABLE. Period. Exposed brick, a white clean look and argyle? Yes please. In fact, I want that argyle wall in my house. I demand it be done.

Everyone was super helpful when I paced and wandered.. wondering just what to get for my first experience. I decided to try two flavors, banana and butter pecan, thinking one would clearly top the other. The result? Both win. So. I got them both. That and a red velvet cookie. I mean, come on, who can resist that?

The ice cream is just what this area has been missing all along. I was secretly hoping for an endless bowl the entire time, though my stomach was clearly telling me I needed to stop indulging. It had the right amount of sweet and salty combined and was just pure heaven. Especially when eaten on the gorgeous patio they share with Windsor. 

Why the 4 stars then? The cookie. Oh that cookie needs some work. The entire outer edge was hard and nearly stale. I think it was due to sitting out all day, but that still should've been remedied. My grandma can send me cookies from 4 states away that still manage to get there soft as they were out of the oven. Maybe that's why I demand more out of my cookies. Don't worry though, I'll be back... but you will need to try harder to woo me next time.

Swaddee is hidden away in the corner of a plaza, but the inside decor does not disappoint. It's not too large and not too small. Rather, it's just the right size. The tables were simple. We had a one with a black cloth, an image centered in the middle, and a glass overlay but I was completely drawn to it. 

We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It had the right amount of spices and flavor as well as the right amount of heat. My main course was the pineapple curry (medium), which was just as incredible. It was a little hotter than medium, which was perfect and full of flavor. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the pineapple was fresh. For dessert, my friend ordered the coconut ice cream and I ordered the golden banana (banana and coconut in a spring roll). We ended up each taking half the banana and opening it like a spring roll and putting ice cream on top. Hands down this is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even if you dine alone at Swaddee, you *have* to order both. I'm not going to lie. I might come back here just for dessert.

Really? No one's reviewed Co+Hoots yet? 

Co+Hoots is a great space in an old building on 7th Street near Roosevelt. It's a place for small businesses, the self-employed and anyone else interested to have a space to work that's not their house. It allows for brainstorming, socializing and bouncing ideas off others. There are both rates for drop in one time visits and for packages for full-time inhabitants. 

The work environment is an open collaborative space with meeting rooms to use when needed.

I've been there several times for both professional organization meetings and social events and every time I find it hard to leave. There's such a welcoming vibe and the creativity that abounds in that place is astounding. 

If you need a place to work for a day to get out of your element, a place to call home for your business of 1, a spot to hold a meeting or a swanky sexy space to hold an after hours gallery or social event, this is your place.

I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.

Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.

I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy.

I went through a series of tests in which each one was explained to me beforehand. It was very comforting to know exactly what I was getting into.

The first time I ever attempted to go there I found some great things, but not at reasonable prices. When I headed to checkout I wanted to scream. What a horrible checkout procedure. The lines are long for not reason other than you have to wait for someone to tell you what line to go to. It's like constantly buying things from Best Buy at Christmas.

Today I came back to return it and try again. I was the only person in the return line with four people working and it took me 10 minutes to even be able to speak with an employee. It then took another 10 minutes to return my one item. After that disaster was finally over, I headed to find another replacement. I decided to ask an employee if they knew of any with the small netbook tip. I was directed to the iGos which is what I tried last time. I informed them that I tried a different iGo package last time and the ""netbook"" tip didn't work. I asked if they knew of anything else.

Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.

While the outside still looks temporary, I assure you the inside is filled with happiness and kindness. And yumminess.

It didn't take long before an employee asked me if I had been there before, and explained to me how it works. The easy part most people get is that it works like most other fro-yo places in the area where you make your own concoction and pay by the weight. However, there's lots of organic yummy stuff too. Their smoothies use yogurt instead of milk from what I was told (which sounded heavenly). 

It looked like there were a ton of toppings to choose from and about 7 or so different flavors of fro-yo. Since I was on a smoothie mission though, I didn't take a great while to look at those in detail. I did notice on top of the toppings bar though, a sign that said they always have bananas and will slice one up for you upon request. BONUS!! BANANA BONUS!!

I loved the smoothie options available, as they weren't all filled with strawberries and other things I am not a fan of. Why people want seeds all up in their smoothie is something I don't yet understand. So I ordered a pineapple banana smoothie (my two most favoritest fruits) with some protein and energy boost. 

While I waited I noticed that there were lots of great signs along their walls informing patrons of what separates them from other fro-yo places as well as lovely little sign on how to make your own fro-yo sundae if you are late to the game :). I also noticed they have a club card that is free where you accumulate points per purchase. One downfall is that there isn't much seating - probably about 10 or so high bar type chairs along the back wall, but I've never seen too many people ever sit and eat in one of these joints, so it may not be a complete deal breaker.

It's a small but very cute and super friendly place and I really enjoyed the smoothie. I usually end up making my own because it's more convenient and I can get exactly what I want. But now I know, if push comes to shove, I can get exactly what I want here too.",2,0,0

Vegetarian or not, there's always a pasty for everyone. Every time I've gone to either location, I've never gotten the same one twice, and I still have over 3\/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones I would love to enjoy. They're big enough that half the time I end up taking half home with me... though that's probably because I after trying the Banoffee Pie, I haven't been able to not order it since. So usually it's take half my pasty home and split Banoffee, which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet. 

All the items are made there, and if you sit at the bar\/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant. It's kinda fun really. Sometimes I watch a little too closely if I know they're making a favorite, trying to figure out how I can mimic this masterpiece at home. Alas, I've always ended up failing. 

One thing to note is that while they make them there, they prep them in advance so you cannot substitute. However, I've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so I can enjoy it a few days later.

So, back to this Banoffee Pie deal... I think I need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review. So, it's a pretty awesome dessert. First, you start with a thick graham cracker crust.

I loved the bar and talking with the chefs while I was eating. While sitting at the bar the first time, I even got to watch a lemon juggling act while eating my mochi.. which was DELICIOUS btw.

The decor was a great compliment to the night of sexy pretentiousness that preceded it. The couches were fairly comfortable.

Now. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a sushi fanatic. It's gone on way too long to just be a phase. The service is great here, the sushi comes out quick, and it will always up the rating of your day by at least 2 points. If you want to get the full effect, sit at the bar.

I've eaten in and ordered out several times and no matter what my food's ready just when it's supposed to be. The nigiri is oh so good. Thinking about it now makes me lean towards Hana tonight. Anyone game? The basic rolls are anything but basic here, all of them made with love.. and fish that want you to enjoy them. 

Sadly I admit I was turned off by the specialty rolls my first visit, because they weren't wrapped very tightly and I didn't look very lady-like while eating them. But I've gotten over that. Sometimes I'm not a lady. And they were delicious. I'll deal with it. You should too.

Hana's a small joint. Sometimes there's a little bit of a line. Nevertheless though, it never seems to ever be so crowded anyone gets annoyed. The staff is efficient, and the sushi is worth it.",4,4,4

I found Coup Des Tartes on a whim and decided it was the perfect spot for a girls lunch with some coworkers to just chill without the guys upon my return home. I was right on the money. The place is cozy and inviting and I love the house setting that just makes you want to let you guard down. Right near our table was a photo of a flower girl and ring bearer at a wedding, just like one you'd have hanging in the hallway at your house. Everything was beautiful, right down to the French limonade bottle used for our water at the table. 

I can also honestly say pretty much all the food is good, well at least the appetizers and desserts... we shared a lot of items and never made it to a main course. Here are the items we had (prepare for a long list):

Soup of the Day (Roasted Red Pepper)
Brie Brulee
Chevre \/ Tomate
Three Onion Tarte
Latte with a shot of hazelnut
Banana Brulee
Chocolate Peanut Butter Tarte

I have to say that everything was truly decadent and I wanted to eat 50 more of them. The red pepper soup was the perfect starter and had just the right amount of flavor. The three onion tarte we split and downed within probably a minute or so!! This also came with a side of lettuce with a shallot vinaigrette for an added bonus (yum). I don't like tomatoes so I have to admit I didn't really have the main part of the chevre\/tomate but the cheese and bread it was on was absolutely delicious. And the brie? Yum.... oh the beautiful brie. The carmelized apples on top..mmmmmmmmm an the fruits and bread with it really topped it all off perfectly.

Just when we thought we were all done, we were told about banana brulee and chocolate peanut butter tart. How delicious were both of them. On what we thought were full stomachs, we devoured them whole while I also enjoyed a latte with a shot of hazelnut. It came with a cube of raw sugar and was placed in the most simple yet adorable coffee cup and saucer. 

In the end, the price was well worth it and the staff was amazing and kind. They gave us just the right amount of space and truly let us enjoy ourselves. The pounds my scale added to my weight afterward was well worth it. It just means salad and a run tonight :)

Thank you Coup Des Tartes. I'll definitely be back. I haven't had a chance to try lunch or dinner yet :)",4,1,2

This was also one of the first places I found upon moving to the valley with the help of a flyer I received at an event.  It is quite a drive for me, but *always* worth it.

First things first. The ice cream and sorbets are insanely delicious. No words anyone writes in one of these reviews could possibly accurately describe the goodness of Sweet Republic. However, I would like to quote one of my friends who had their ice cream for the first time at a recent First Friday. After having a couple bites, they looked at me and said, ""Now I know why you drive so far to get this. This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted.""

The atmosphere there is so fun and uplifting. They have outdoor and indoor seating, games to play (including connect four) and free wifi. The mint and orange creamsicle decor has such a refreshing and comforting feel. 

However, one of my favorite aspects to Sweet Republic is being adventurous. I encourage everyone going to have a try of a few different ones there before deciding on what to get. Also, try something you never thought you would. You'll be pleasantly surprised, because not only will it taste exactly like you imagined, but it will be yummy! The owners put a lot of thought and time into their ice cream and I love tasting the new things they've made and hearing their stories about how sometimes it sounds just as crazy to them and ends up being fantastic. 

Sweet Republic is well worth the trip, no matter where you live in the valley. I don't know one person that has gone and been disappointed.",5,4,5

My expectations were not what Compound Grill ended up being, but not really in a bad way, just in that different way. 

The stage first off.. is fantastic, and I love the tables around it - reminds me of music halls I haven't seen in ages. I really wanted to jump on the stage and sing, but someone else was doing that already.. and they were doing it all right! So very right! Great mix of songs from the Beatles to GaGa done by a woman. AMEN SISTA!!!!!

The rest of the place was laid out kinda odd in my opinion, including a set of couches to sit and eat at that were set up around a support post. Around a fire pit, I could see. Around a cute coffee table.. yes. Staring at a post in the ground that doesn't even have art on it or anything, no... and well, as you can probably guess, no one was sitting there that night either. In fact, they were sitting everywhere BUT that spot. 

The service was eh... didn't really seem to willing or wanting.

The menu looked okay, but nothing I was screaming over. We ended up having some chips and salsa that includes a tomatillo\/avacado salsa that I enjoyed :) I also really appreciate the organic hippie vibe that I didn't expect going in. Sexy hippy.. that's what I'm labeling this from now on.

As I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).

Everyone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.

It all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.

I left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.

Kabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.

This past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there. 

We started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were. 

We both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.

In the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).

There are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service.",6,3,3

Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means. 

Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring.

It's almost hard to believe we all ate at the same establishment. 

I made my first visit to My Florist for a fabulous #smunch breakfast with friends. I had never been but had looked at their website and just loved the story of the restaurant. Someplace with character, that's more than a building definitely gets my attention. The photos on the website also do not do this place justice. Every time my gaze wandered around various parts of My Florist I was continually floored. It's so beautiful and such a great conversation piece. When our huge group was seated we lucked out and got what I like to refer to as the king's table. The chairs were so exquisite to look at and even more comfortable than they appeared. I just sank into them and hit an instant pre food happy coma. Everyone seems to have issues with the piano, but I kinda wished they were playing. I almost went and started playing myself. 

As far as the food, I have mixed feelings. I started off with a mimosa which was excellent and very reasonably priced. I then had wanted the frittata but they were pre-made and I was unable to have it without tomato. I am not a fan of pre-made... or tomato. Having to make a last minute decision I went with my staple, an omelet. I had Gruyere, chicken, and mushroom and a side of Nutella for my toast. I also ordered a limosa.

The omelet was okay but not outstanding and a little pricey. However, I immensely enjoyed the toast. Non ordinary toast makes me happy. The side of Nutella was a little pricey in my opinion, but was huge. I was able to use gobs for both my pieces of toast and someone else's. I think the eggs benedict that a few got looked tasty and I'd go again to try that. The salad menu also looked delightful. The limosa? Delicious.

As far as service goes, I didn't have any issues. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly and didn't mind our crazy large party of nearly 12.

I love my spice... don't get me wrong. I usually order my Thai on the high end of the spice scale. Spice is a great way to get a flavorful dish. It also can reveal the caliber of the place you are ordering from. Typically a take out Chinese establishment is not going to offer a scale for their spice. It's not a Thai restaurant. They simply indicate with a little pepper when something is going to be spicy.

My dish which was a scallop dish was very overpowering on the spice end, and not in a good way. The spice completely overpowered my food and any good flavor that could've resulted. 

I may try it again and order a non spicy dish to see how that ends up, but for now, it's out of rotation on my take out list.",2,1,1

I posted on facebook about my frustration and get a response to try 35th Ave Sew and Vac. I didn't hesitate as I was desperate and in the mood to shop. Having one of the cross streets in the name is a huge help too, let me tell ya. I found the place easily and was excited to get started in my search.

Then a skinny hallway and narrow beacon of light directed me to the mecca of fabric. I was lost in no time, wandering about the rows and admiring the selections. They were categorized beautifully and the taxonomy\/library science geek in me swooned. Everything was so easy to find.

Finally I made a decision and headed to the checkout. They were so nice and friendly and it was a breeze to pay and make my way home to use my newly found goods.

On recommendation of the server, my debate between the spinach mushroom omelet and the eggs Benedict ended with the Benedict. I probably would've rather had the omelet or some a la carte items.

When the light rail opened I rarely rode it at first. The hours sucked and the last thing I wanted was to end up stranded in Phoenix because I refused to leave by 11pm. 

Now the weekend hours at least have changed, and while sometimes it still sucks (house parties don't always end at 2am), I mostly like it. I've found myself taking the light rail even more now that I am back from a stint overseas and hating driving my car.

Unfortunately I am only able to use the light rail for recreational reasons as I work in Snottsdale, and they, apparently, aren't fans of the light rail. My only hope is to have it hit farther in Tempe or Mesa that I can take my bike and ride a few miles in after a stop... but I don't think that will happen either.

The adventures are fun on the LR and it's actually helped this newby that's terribly unblessed with being navigationally challenged on top of it to navigate the Phoenix area, downtown in particular.

It was a few miles from my house and down an old back road, smack dab in the middle of gorgeous scenery. There is a very large indoor area to sit as well as a large outdoor area as well, and a pond and vineyard on site.

It well beat out the bar scene for several reasons. First off was that you could bring in your own dinner and enjoy a bottle of wine and dinner with friends. For this reason, it ended up being the location for several of my birthday parties. 15 of us or so would grab a table, bring some delicious tapas, someone would bring a cake, and we'd have several bottles of wine and still be able to have a conversation. Being on a back road it was easy to get home and there was never traffic. They had board games available also and snack plates of their own.

Their wine is incredible. I remember the day I had my first taste of their Red Kiss. At the time it wasn't even being bottled and was only available in house. They bottled it a few months later, at Thanksgiving and I gave it to many friends and family members as presents. The perfect combination of chocolate and red wine (neither of which I like separately) was irresistible. Their ice wine is to die for, and I love their party wine with the crazy gnome on the label.

Now that I have that off my chest I have to say I'm confused. Why? Because, according to yelp, the Mazda dealership near 16th St & Camelback brands its service department under a completely different name. But I have never experience that in my contact with them or mailings I receive. It's always been Camelback Mazda. Alas, I am getting service, so I guess this is the company I need to file it under.

After being here a few times, I have to say it's pretty much so-so. The first time I was here, I had an amazing experience with the service department. Iain was fantastic and told me what was up and showed me what was going on. I hate when mechanics and service staff just assume I'm gonna throw money at them without understanding the issue. It's crazy. He also gave me a loaner car when it was going to be longer than expected, which I truly appreciate. Granted it was a horrid orange Subaru wagon\/SUV thing that was SO not my Mazda, but it worked.

This time, I'm a little less optimistic. The time it took me to even get my car into service was a nightmare. I sat there while some typing was going on and questions were asked that should've been in my record and on my appointment (like WTF I'm getting done). Other Mazda dealerships I've been to have had that ready when I got there. I just review sign, and go hop to my coworking. The end. Get with it. It took 15 minutes for my car to even get back there. Maybe I should get here 20 minutes early next time. 

However, the lobby if you need to wait is fantastic. I always choose to sit and wait because it gives me time to catch up on things, like yelp reviews. There's a TV, some couches, high tables to sit and work at, wifi, popcorn, coffee, soda, and slushies. Oh and this great photo wall of people kayaking. I uploaded it so you don't miss out.

The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.

We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. 

For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.

My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! 

My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. 

Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. 

Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.",2,1,1

I stalked it clear back when it was first announced... and when only digital renderings were available... when I kept wanting to visit but it was a drive...

And then it happened. I had the opportunity to go and I was so excited. I examined the exhibits one more time online. And arrived before my date to take in the outside. It's beautiful. The whole building is absolutely beautiful. The outside courtyard. The contours and lines of the inside.

Nearly every exhibit has a sample of the music and dance of the region\/country and so they aren't all interfering with each other, they give you headsets to wear during the tour. Usually I pass on these, but this wasn't additional information, it was part of the exhibit. So I walked around, looking like a doofus but geeking out on music.

The museum has a lot of stuff. A lot. Nearly every country is represented. Countries most don't normally associate with having their own music, such as Afghanistan. It was amazing to see the differences and the similarities in the instruments. The low fidelity versus the highly detailed, each works of art in their own way. My mind wandered and I daydreamed as I explored. One thing I realized is while all countries have something in common typically (same types of instruments), the US is seriously lacking in things that rattle.. bracelets, skirts, headdresses, etc... I call for more rattling in our instruments.

Some other interesting things I found were a hot pink star guitar, that made me want to try to play the guitar again, tiny instruments, and a Victory Piano, which I've never seen up close and in person until this trip. And the piano rooms... and organ rooms... oh sweet heaven. Good thing they had lots of security.. because I was SO TEMPTED to sit and play. I wanted to play all those pianos so badly.  They do have some rooms where you can try and do some hands on stuff.. but it's never the same as the works of art that are for display only.

Towards the end, the museum was closing and I found it hard to take time to see the rest... and I'd already spent 3 hours there...I probably needed another hour or so.

I'm sure this space is going to be great for concerts and I really enjoyed my trip. So why the sad 3 stars? Two main reasons:

1) It's supposed to be a museum, which to me is something you can enjoy time and time again. As of now, it doesn't look like they have any rotating or special exhibits, which will make it hard to justify a return.

2) The navigation is horrible. There are multiple entrances to each region, but only one is the ""right one"" that allows you to navigate in a normal pattern. However, you have no guides with signage or anything on which is the preferred entrance (though I beg to ask why is there more than one if one leads you in an unnatural pattern). They put so much time, money and effort into this museum.. I really wish they had hired some UX folk. If they did, I wish they were better.

It's worth a visit.. honestly. Especially if you are a music geek like myself. I'm just not sure it's worth more than that.",1,0,2

I went years before realizing El Coquito was within walking distance of my office. And it didn't take more than a few days before we were dying to try it once we found out. 

El Coquito is kinda tucked away in an old plaza off of McDowell on Granite Reef. The inside has a nice homey feel to it. Various tables of different sizes, pictures on the wall, a TV playing some good ol' futbol. We arrived 5 minutes before the website said they open, and we weren't even the first ones there. Fair warning, that you may want to give yourself time as the place is small and appears to fill up fast.

Be assured though, that the service is still top notch. We were greeted promptly and our food came quickly and just as ordered. I ordered the mofongo with pork and an unleaded coquito. And for the half hour I sat and savored that meal, I was completely overcome with bliss. The textures were great, everything was the right consistency and temperature and the flavors were amazing. Be prepared for the high garlic content, especially if you use the extra garlic that comes on the side, which I did. May want to wait while before smooching anyone. 

Highly recommended, and a place I know I will be back to on various occasions. For those wanting to go with a group of friends or coworkers, splitting the bill was no issue.",2,0,2

Equipment: Would give 4 stars due to equipment being down for a long time, but when I ask when it's getting fixed, the employees have an answer for me for the most part. For example the Smith Machine has been down for a while, but they explained that the part they need is coming in December, so at least they have an answer. Other than that, there is a wide variety of equipment to use and it's never TOO crowded or busy so something you need is bound to be open. 
Personal trainers: of course it's their job to sell you packages, so they can be pushy, but even when you don't buy a package they still walk around and are supportive of other people exercising which I think is nice.
Cleanliness: is good enough, I have noticed the last month or so that employees are doing a better job cleaning.

My only problem with the restaurant was that it didn't have a very clear ordering system. You have to give your order and then you sit down and they serve you. Even as we were taking our order it wasn't a very clear interaction. Over all though; the food is just so fantastic you won't remember anything else!",3,5,4

We entered into the restaurant and were seated right by the door which was unpleasant because of the cold winter draft we were hit with every few minutes. We looked around and there was a table at the back that we took the liberty of moving to; alas we weren't seated there initially!

I started off with a hot & sour soup which tasted okay but was the strangest shade of light grey; not the usual colour one expects! We all ordered fried dumplings - I ordered the tofu vegetable kind. It took absolute ages for our food to arrive which was really unexpected. Alas, it was not worth the wait. The filling of my dumplings were too salty and the skins were dry. My friend's dumplings were served in a plate that was pooling with water; which filled their dumplings making them soggy. 

It was all so inconsistent with mediocre service, a long wait and food that was sloppy. Perhaps we went at a bad time but I was left with a bad impression that doesn't entice me to return. 

The only thing worth noting is that they had 4 types of veggie dumplings on the menu which is a greater variety than normal.",2,1,1

Comment from Boba S. of Kung Fu Tea 
Business Owner
9\/19\/2016  Hello KATHIE

I appreciate you taking the time to write your thoughts and opinions about the Kung Fu Tea franchise.

I did some investigating on your visit today and I do apologize for some misunderstandings here.  I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.

I do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  

You can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.

Dominic
************UPDATE\/RESPONSE*** 9\/20\/2016**********************
Thank you for your reply.

Who are you suggesting I question, and about what?

As a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he ""should"" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.

Dominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as

 ""I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy."" 

YOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur. BUT you mentioned nothing of the sort. I'm a little disappointed.",0,0,0

I asked the cashier ""When you have a moment could you please come wipe out table down its kind of sticky"" the place was dead and he wasn't occupied but he never came. Ok I thought no worries. Our food was delivered to us by another gentlemen by the name of Daniel. I asked Daniel ""Could you wipe the table down for us when you get a chance"" he replied ""sure"". As he walked away with his back turned to he says ""a please would be appreciated "" in a completely passive aggressive tone. He's right I should have said please but that doesn't change the fact that he was being completely unprofessional. When he came back I proceeded to address the situation as he comment made me feel really uncomfortable. I told him hey I don't appreciate being spoken to In such an aggressive manner. He then proceeded to argue and escalate the situation in a completely immature way. Cherry on top when our argument concluded he followed it up with ""cool story bro"" that really got my blood boiling. I'm not one to complain but I felt the need to get a manager involved at this point. Their employee had disrespected me and was being completely unprofessional.

They essentially blew me off and expect me to believe that will address the situation with the runner? Yea, I don't think so. It wasn't until another runner came out from the kitchen and acknowledged the situation and explained that Daniel can be a bit of a dick. It isn't my fault that's he's a dick or is having a bad day.

We started with guacamole which was ok... not the best I have had but had decent flavor. You can tell it was homemade but the flavor was more salty\/oniony rather than creamy avocado with some lime. 

They mentioned they were out of homemade chips but then made some out of the tortilla's they had. These were LOADED with salt and I think they knew it so they comped the guacamoles and chips app. This was a nice gesture and we appreciated it.  

The queso dip was not the best. It was grainy and didnt have that velvety texture or cheesy flavor that I am normally used to with queso. I wouldnt recommend. 

I ordered the chicken milanese torta. Now I have had many authentic torta's and this WAS NOT A TORTA. This is a chicken milanese sandwich. A torta has a special kind of combination of ingredients and this wasnt it. I will say this was a very good sandwich but definitely should not be classified as a torta. Not sure if it is a play on words.

The tacos were the best part of the night. The mahi taco was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well. The other tacos were similarly delicious.

I wasnt the biggest fan of how they served them because no one really knew which ones were which and when we did it was awkward getting them from the big tray to our plates.

It's a very casual place that caters to convenience of being right there and serves trendy and upscale Americanized Asian bistro. Of course, like most of these hotel restaurants, it prices itself way high and makes you think you're getting a better experience than you really are getting. The service is decent, not great, but decent. 

On my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.

I applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of ""what do you want to eat,"" not ""can I answer any questions you might have?""

That's a shame, because my experience was fantastic.

We had a 6:45pm reservation (made months in advance) and had to wait 30 minutes when we arrived. The manager personally came out to apologize to us and offered us drinks and dessert on the house for the entire evening. I've been to plenty of places where they sort of shaft you on the amount of alcohol - not here. I ordered a Jack & Coke with a lime wedge to start off with and the bartender, on his own, made it with Gentleman Jack and it was stiff to say the least. Nice crushed ice served in a very unique high ball glass. All night long, they made sure that a fresh high ball glass of our drinks were following as soon as one was empty. 

With what I thought was a proper handling of the table situation, we waited for our table to open, sipping drinks and admiring the scenery. Once seated, we ordered the Port Judith Calimari and the seared yellowfin tuna for starters. Both were outstanding. I'm a harsh judge of calimari and Emeril's did not disappoint. Still not the best I've ever had, but definitely up there. I ordered the pecan crusted Texas redfish, pepper jack potato rosti, creole meuniere sauce and grilled vegetable ratatouille. It was absolutely delicious. The smash across the face you received from the melody of flavors was incredible. I don't recall what my friend ordered but he was raving about it.

For dessert, we were told by our waitress if there is one dessert you must try, it is Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. Words fail to describe how delicious and filling this was. It was served in a nice warm cast iron skillet, with gorgeous chocolate shavings nestled on top.  

The service: top notch. Our waitress was prompt, courteous, full of recommendations and explanations of flavors on each dish, and never far from us. Zero complaints. I never once had to ask for anything - it just appeared. 

The interior d√©cor: well thought out, with a nice earth tone color scheme which is accentuated by a wide variety of brilliant sapphire blues, yellows, purples, reds, and silvers at the bar and around the restaurant. It has a very trendy, but authentic New Orleans flare to it. The bar at the center has a nice feel to it, with nicely back lit liquor shelves to showcase Emeril's offerings. There is a ridiculous amount of wine racks all around the exterior of the restaurant, giving patrons quite the selection from which to choose.

The price: frankly, I thought the prices on the menu were fair for the caliber of restaurant such as Emeril's in a city like Vegas. My entr√©e was $28, and when I got the bill, much to my surprise, the manager had also comped our appetizers. So all we ended up paying for was our entr√©es. Really, that is going above and beyond to correct a mistake.

The manager paid us a visit once at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, apologizing once again for the delay, and asking us if we would come back. The answer was a resounding yes. We thanked him for his hospitality and his drive to make our visit the best it could be.

I am sure sorry if Emeril's at the MGM Grand has gone downhill since I visited a few years back. But I stand by my review. When I was there, they treated us incredibly well and made a faux pax on their part with our reservation right.",3,0,1

I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.

However, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30\/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the ""you're not going to believe this just happened to me"" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.

Everything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio.

If you want action, MGM is hopping 24\/7 with action. The casino is so huge that I still haven't seen all of the 170,000+ square feet of gaming area. MGM sort of bridges the gap between a great casino and a great resort. It ties both in with a proper attention given to both. You can find very reasonable rates per night there. It's conveniently located at the South end of the strip, so coming from McCarron International, your cab fees will be light. When you pull up to the MGM, you can just sense the rich history of this place. The epic pay-per-view boxing matches, the world-renowned shows, the great concerts, etc. When the sign says ""The City of Entertainment,"" you have no problem believing it. The lobby is a beautiful marble with the MGM lion front and center. It is a grand entrance, which is both breathtaking and elegant. 

From a gaming perspective, I love that the MGM connects both low rollers and high rollers and doesn't discriminate their table offerings based upon a crowd they're trying to attract, such as The Wynn, The Bellagio, or the Venetian. You can easily still find $5 blackjack tables there, and of course, the $100 tables are always available. The mid-range rooms are very nice. The beds are super comfortable, nice blackout curtains in the afternoon to block out that intense summer time sun. The bathrooms are spacious and luxuriously appointed. 

Of all the casinos I've visited, the dealers at the MGM have been by far the most cool, down-to-earth, fun, funny and engaged. The casino has many restaurants, including Emeril's, there are day spas, pool and beach area for the kids, and nice shops if that's your thing.

I had the fortune of a friend treating me to the stay while we were in town for the WSOP. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. 

The room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel\/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.

Fortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the ""older"" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. 

Yeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. 

On the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted.

I think it's fitting that this place stands where the Sands used to stand. The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.

They spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses.

I stayed here last week for my vacation, not at all what I expected the service and people are not worth the price.  They have no idea what customer service means, only the front desk do unfortunately.  If it weren't for the front desk I would give it 1 star only.

I went to the concierge to ask for a great  Italian restaurant for lunch.  Unfortunately concierge recommended a restaurant they haven't eaten because the food was horrible you can read it from my other review Dal Toro, don't go there please. 

I went back to concierge after lunch to ask where can we sit since we are waiting to check in and it's not 3pm yet.  A lady told me there is no sitting area, we have to go to a cafe.  I thought this is odd, a big hotel like this no seating area. I can't bring my kid to the gaming area, this is why I need a place for her. I found at least 3 areas on my own, thanks for nothing... 

I got to my room, the cheese crumbs was still on the couch.  My hubby is nice enough to clean.  We had to wait 2 hrs for our luggage from the bell boys. REALLY!!! My husband had to call to ask them about it. 

We ended up sleeping in a comforter that was wrapped with a fitted sheet, which means no comforter cover and no sheets. We got hot at night and realized there was no sheets... The next day I asked a house keeper is it normal they don't provide sheets for the bed. It turns out my room wasn't clean.  Oh great mind you I took a bath and used the bathroom too. Now I am really disgusted.

We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.

I stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. 

This tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio ""All Suites"" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other ""Strip"" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there ""Ghetto"" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. 

Since my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump.

3. The entres came and were greatly satisfying.  The Marlin had a nice lime aioli.  The pasta had a large portion of different shellfish that were quite delicious.  
4.  Great selections from the desserts offered this week.  It was really hard to choose, and when ours arrived, they were great!

There was a group of about 10 of us, and we had tried to get in a few weeks earlier around 10:15 at night and the line was ridiculous! As we were keen to go to Rock n Horses, we decided to make a reservation for dinner for my friend's celebration. The reservation was for 6:30, and we were told that we would need to finish our meals by 9 because they would need to move our table off of the dance floor since we were a big group. Rock n Horses certainly isn't busy early on in the night, but there are some definite advantages to arriving early:

1) Free coat check (I believe before 9)
2) No cover
3) Guaranteed entry - no need to wait in slow moving lines!
4) $15 bottles of wine on Fridays between 5 and 7 (warning: this is not good quality wine!)

The food is pretty good and presented well for a bar. However we were a bit disappointed to hear that they were already out of corn on the cob when we placed our orders at 7. 

I had the garlic prawns ($12 - white wine, chilli garlic butter, grilled bread) without the butter. I also made a last minute adjustment to my meal and asked to have a side salad instead of the grilled bread. The waitress was great and rushed to see if they could accommodate my request. Although this dish is listed as a starter, it could easily be a main as it comes with plenty of shrimp! The shrimp arrive in a small cast iron skillet on top of a wooden board and the salad came in a bowl to the side. The shrimp were well cooked and very flavourful, and the salad really exceeded my expectations! There were fresh mixed greens along with large pieces of fresh carrots, blanched green beans, cucumbers, and other quality vegetable toppings.

Our server was great and easily managed our group and our complicated orders. The establishment also allowed us to bring in our own cupcakes for our friend's birthday; however, given the theme of the venue I was expecting a bit more in terms of 'presentation' when we asked for the cupcakes - a song or something would have been nice! One hiccough with the service was that we did not receive separate bills. Our server was able to ring us through on separate credit cards though.

The rest of the evening was pretty fun with a number of group members getting up for a ride on the mechanical bull! The music was your typical country tunes, with staff members providing line dancing 'lessons' early on in the evening. I didn't find that the venue ever got particularly busy or crowded, so there was never a long wait to be served at the bar.

I have been going here for about three years now, and it is my go-to for Greek food. I have dined in, have ordered take out, and have ordered delivery without any issues and without compromising on food quality. It trumps the Greek restaurants on the Danforth where I find the food can often be too salty and oily.

The food is delicious and the customer service is great. My favourite dish is the village salad (big fresh chunks of peppers, cucumbers, onions, feta, and olives) topped with either grilled chicken, grilled calamari, or grilled shrimp. The grilled calamari is one of the best I have had, but you really can't go wrong with any of the three! The chicken souvlaki is also great. Even the small size is quite large, so if you order the regular size, be prepared to bring home leftovers! My friend ordered the Greek chicken wrap for take-out and it was massive - like two meals in one! I also really enjoy the complimentary grilled pita they give you as an appetizer topped with olive oil and garlic (they also provide this with all take out and delivery orders). It is especially yummy dipped in their hummus.

In addition to the quality of the food, the prices are fantastic! Especially given that within a five minute walk from the restaurant you will pay twice the price for half of the food.

I came in the early afternoon to purchase some fruit and vegetable party trays that I was going to bring to a meeting later on that evening. I was going to be passing the Sobeys again on my way from home to the meeting, but I didn't really want to carry the trays back and forth. I asked the manager if they would put the trays aside for me to pick up later, and she readily agreed to keep them in a downstairs fridge for me.

Sobeys is my neighbourhood grocery store of choice, but they lose a star for not being 24 hours and for tending to have higher prices and a smaller selection than the Metro.",0,0,0

In the past I have often ordered the mixed house greens salad (tomato, cucumber, red onion and shredded carrots, tossed in our famous balsamic dressing, $10) and have asked for it to be topped with grilled shrimp (it's not an explicit option listed on the menu, but you can ask for it, $5). It's typically a pretty good dish that I enjoy. This time I had a number of issues with my experience at Brownstone Bistro

1) There were ice chunks in my shredded carrot! (I think there's enough said with that)
2) $5 for 3 measly pieces of shrimp seems quite excessive, especially when the shrimp were not very good. I don't know how they were cooked, but it tasted as though they were soaked in butter or oil. They were not very good.
3) Out of green tea - how does a restaurant run out of green tea for brunch?!
4) My dish did not come with fruit but my friends' did. I noticed that they received much less fruit than they had on previous visits.
5) Our server was rather slow and inattentive especially towards the end. We ended up sitting around waiting for our bills for quite some time. It wasn't too bad because we were having a good conversation, but It would have been nice had she checked in on us sooner.

I ordered two appetizer dishes for my meal:
1) Misticanza - mixed lettuces, celery hearts, radish, aged sherry vinaigrette ($8) - this was a good salad and a decent sized portion for an appetizer
2) Frutti di Mare - marinated shrimp, scallops, calamari, red onion, crostini ($11.50) - this was like a ceviche (although with cooked seafood) or a seafood salad with a vinaigrette-type dressing served in a dish with two small and rather thin pieces of crostini on the side. If you order this dish, I would recommend that you get a salad too because you receive much more seafood than could possibly fit on the two pieces of crostini, so I ended up using the left over seafood as a topping on my salad.

I was the first to arrive and asked to be seated on the back patio as it was one if Toronto's beautiful summer nights and I had heard great things about the patio. Our waitress was extremely attentive and good-natured. I had a number of questions about the menu and she was able to answer all of them with ease and provided a number of good recommendations. I was initially seated at one of the tables at the back of the patio, but was hoping to sit at a booth. One of the booths became available while I was waiting for my friends to arrive, and our server was more than willing to allow me to change tables.

The dishes are fairly small here so we ordered a number - some we shared and some we had to ourselves.

For myself I ordered:
Ontario Spring Salad - this had good fresh vegetables, but I found the dressing to be really oily and I didn't like how salt and pepper were already on the salad when it was served as I found the salad to be quite salty.

Ol' shrimp bucket - this was a really yummy dish! I was surprised by the number of shrimp I received (maybe 11-12 large pieces) as I believe this dish was cheaper than the peel-your-own shrimp from the bar yet had more shrimp! I would have to caution though to be prepared for your hands to get messy because you have to peel your own shrimp, and the shrimp are marinated in a delicious seasoning. I would definitely recommend this dish.

Dishes we shared \/ ordered by my friends:

Scallops - 3 big scallops served with a pea pur√©e. The scallops were cooked perfectly, my only complaint is that I wish it came with more! Another winning dish!

Fish and chips - my friend ordered this and thought the fish was cooked well and not too greasy. She also raved about the fries.

Grilled corn -  two large, seasoned cobs of corn. Another item loved by my friends.

Lobster taco - this was probably the most disappointing dish of the night. While it was still good, my friend thought it was a bit of a let down compared to other dishes we had that evening.

It's a very friendly restaurant with a real family feel. It is casual, yet nice enough if you want a celebratory dinner. Due to the family-friendly feel, children are more than welcome here, although you won't see them running around or disrupting things. 

The wait staff are wonderful here. Everyone, including the owners are so warm and welcoming, and if you want to come on a Friday or Saturday night, you had better call ahead for a table because it is not uncommon to see a group of people standing at the door trying to come in and then have to be turned away because they are all booked up! If you are a regular, the wait staff truly makes an effort to get to know you. They know exactly what every member of my family will order every time we come - they might as well start preparing the dishes the second we walk in the door!

The menu is not huge, but they have pretty much everything you would expect at an Italian restaurant. If they don't have exactly what you are looking for, don't be afraid to ask. They are very accommodating and open to making substitutions. For example, I don't like mushrooms and they will gladly replace the mushrooms in the pasta primavera with asparagus or another vegetable. One time I was feeling like having some calamari in my pasta, and although this is not found on the menu, they happily made this for me. Although they do not have a specific children's menu, they will definitely custom make dishes to order for the little ones!

The restaurant is quite quaint with quirky decor - mismatched side plates, bright and vibrant paintings, etc.

We were greeted warmly, and although we had a reservation, it was not at all necessary as there were only about two other tables occupied, so we were told we could sit wherever we wanted. The server was very sweet and when she heard that it was our first time there, she was eager to tell us all about the concept of the place and the various events that are held there. 

I had items 1 and 2 as my main. Items 3 and 4 come with a small serving of the butternut squash soup and a very small tasting of each of the three salads in the 3-kind salad.

1) 3-Kind Salad ($9 - baby arugula w\/micro-sprouts, mixed bean, & roasted Ontario beets - vegan and gluten-free)
This was a good dish. The beets could have been roasted slightly longer to become more tender and they could have been seasoned a bit better. 

2) Curried Butternut Squash Soup ($7)
I was really looking forward to this dish as I had read some rave reviews on Yelp. It was a cold day so I was hoping for the soup to be pipping hot. It was definitely warm, but I would have liked it to be that temperature where you just have to give a gentle blow on the spoon before you have your first few sips. You could definitely taste the curry and the soup had a bit of a kick. There was definitely something added to the soup, and I'm not sure what it was (maybe potato?) that muted the flavour of the butternut squash, and I did not like this aspect of the dish. I did not like the bread that was served with the soup. It was more like crostini and it was rather crunchy. I would have preferred soft and fluffy bread that I could have dipped in my soup.

3) Vegetable Keema Curry ($13 - Stewed celery, mushroom, chickpea, onion, carrot, sweet bell pepper - vegan and gluten-free)
This dish was served with brown rice and there were generous portions of both the rice and the curry. I had a taste of my friend's dish and you could definitely appreciate the flavours. There was a strong hint of cinnamon, so if you are averse to cinnamon, I would avoid this dish.

4) Open-Faced Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich ($16) 
This was a chicken breast that was sliced (and appeared to be sprinkled with cinnamon, among other seasonings) served alongside 3 large pieces of bread. The pickled vegetables that the menu's describes consisted of about four small spears of vegetables. There was also a balsamic glaze on the plate as well as three small side dishes of spreads for your sandwich (butter, grainy Dijon, and a red sauce that looked to be spicy). 

The prices were a bit steep for a lunch, but you get a decent amount of food, so it's not bad. However; for a similar soup and salad combo, I would go to the nearby Hibiscus on Augusta Ave for, in my opinion, a much better squash soup and more flavourful salad bowl for about half the price of the soup and salad here.

Our waitress came by after we paid and asked if we wanted some complimentary freshly squeezed juice. She offered us orange, apple, cranberry, or strawberry-basil. We decided to try the strawberry-basil and the cranberry. The strawberry-basil was quite nice and refreshing, and it was the juice we all preferred. The cranberry was fine, but it does not taste like typical cranberry juice. It smelled a bit odd and was not tart or sour like I was expecting when you eat fresh cranberries. Upon asking the waitress about this further, she explained that they do not actually make the juices there, but rather purchase them from another company, and that sweetener was added to the cranberry juice.

I would likely return to this restaurant again, although I will probably stick with Hibiscus as my go-to for a soup and salad combo in the area.",2,0,2

The entrance to the restaurant can best be described as unassuming. It would be easy to miss it.

Two of us arrived for dinner around 5:30 on a Sunday evening without a reservation. We were told the only seats available were at the bar, so we sat there.

The food was good, I will give it that. But there are very few vegetarian dishes, and they were not very accommodating. Here is what we ordered:

Scallop and crema - this is not at all what I was expecting. It was more like a scallop ceviche. It was a cold dish of chopped up scallop on top of crema. I asked if we could have it with the crema on the side and was immediately shot down. I really dislike when restaurants do this and do not accommodate for even slight adjustments to their menu. When the dish arrived, the scallop had literally been scooped on top of the crema, so it could easily have been prepared with the crema on the side.

Green tomatoes - this dish had dollops of chicken liver with tiny slices of fried green tomatoes on top, and then a bed of mixed greens placed on top of all of that. There was a good kick to the chicken liver, but I wouldn't order this dish again.

Shrimp and greens - about 5 pieces of grilled shrimp (cooked well) on top of a lot of buttery-oily sauce, with oily saut√©ed spinach on top. The shrimp were really yummy, but I found the spinach to be quite flavourless.

Mackerel - long thin piece of grilled mackerel on top of a salsa verde that was strongly flavoured with cilantro. I would avoid this dish if you don't like cilantro!!

The music was good here - a mix of Motown and indie stuff. Tip: they don't take American Express.",0,0,0
SRN1uHVsChLJAR42ryKqYg,Kat,CsS9WsonGYyE3vINi5bxSg,"""Carini's Homemade Ice Cream & Gelato""",3,17-05-2014,"I would give Barrio Correano 3.5 stars. I came here with two friends for dinner on a Friday night. I wanted a reservation around 6 or 6:30, but they only had 5:30 available. 

The ambiance and environment is really cool here. It's too bad that the restaurant doesn't have a patio as I'm sure the decor could have been really well done on one. I had the sense that the design was aiming for a rustic, run-down, side-of-the-road Mexican establishment, but with a hip and edgy vibe, and I would say they certain accomplished that feeling. As other reviews have mentioned, there are no paper menus. Their offerings are simply listed on chalkboards on the walls. I did not have an issues with reading the boards as I was sitting right in front of one and the restaurant was not too busy, but I could see how it would be a pain if you are ordering multiple rounds of food or drinks (which is how they recommend ordering) to have to constantly remember what each dish contains. The washrooms are clean, but I only saw a single room for ladies and a single room for men, so I imagine that there can be a line up at times, especially later in the night.

Dishes we ordered:

1) Guacamole and chips - my friends were disappointed that it did not come in a mortar bowl (how it is served at Playa Cabana) because it gave the sense that it was not quite as fresh. Apparently the guac does have a slight kick to it.

2) Fried quaso chihuahua - my friend likes this, but it was also a bit spicy. It is literally a block of fried cheese on a tortilla

3) Kalbi beef taco - we were told that this would be little pieces of charred beef cooked medium-rare. We were all disappointed to see that the meat was definitely more cooked than medium-rare. It was more like medium-well.

4) Baja fish taco - I asked for this to be grilled, not fried, and to have it without the aioli. The waitress was happy to oblige. It was a good dish and I really like the slaw that is served on top, but I thought that the fish was slightly undercooked and I found that the tortilla had gotten a bit soggy (possibly from the fish?) which made it hard to eat. Despite this I was happy to see that they were not stingy on the amount of fish that they provide!

5) Grilled calamari with burnt arbol kimchi - the calamari was delicious, I would definitely recommend ordering it! I did not find that it came with a lot of kimchi, and do not order it thinking that it is like Korean kimchi, because it isn't.

7) Jumbo shrimp taco - this really was a jumbo shrimp which is tempuraed, placed on a tortilla, and loaded with a bunch of toppings. My friend said it was rather spicy, but she really liked it.

Service - I am a bit torn about what to write about this. I had the opposite experience to what other reviews have mentioned. Our server was extremely pleasant and very engaging. She took the time to go through every dish and offering with great detail when we told her that we had not been to the restaurant before. I have a friend who is both vegan and sensitive to gluten (she was not with me on this visit) and so I am always on the look out for places that can cater to both carnivores and people with dietary restrictions. I asked the server about one of their dishes (the portobello fajitas) because it sounded like it could cater to my friend's needs. The waitress said it would fit the bill and she also suggested other dishes that can be adapted to fit my friend's needs. This aspect of service gets five stars! I called earlier in the day to see if it would be possible to change our reservation from 5:30 to 6 because 5:30 is a bit early for dinner. I was told that this would not be possible because there were other groups coming in at 7, and that the restaurant tends to get busy around then. When we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30, we weren't too hungry so we thought we would just enjoy some drinks and guac with chips while we figured out what to eat. I got the sense that they wanted us to move along and order our food because they didn't want us to take up the table for too long. When we left at 7:20, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was only about 60-70% full. As a result, it was disappointing that we were felt a bit rushed earlier on in the meal. We also did not ask for our bill, it was simply placed on our table when we had finished our plates and we were not given the chance to ask for separate bills (although our sever was happy to enter individual amounts when we paid).

Overall I had a good time at Barrio Correano, but I do not feel any real urgency to rush back. I would go if other people wanted to try it out. It won't be a staple in my restaurant repertoire.",0,0,0

My Favourite has been a neighbourhood staple for well over 15 years, and most summer nights you can see crowds of people outside the small store consuming their ice cream and a cluster if people inside waiting to be served. When I was younger, I would eagerly count down the days until My Favourite opened.

For the past few years now, I would say that I have been continuously less impressed. While their product offering had remained the same (Greg's ice cream, create-you-own frozen yoghurt with the choice of two flavours, and a random assortment of Popsicles and frozen treats), their prices have definitely gone up, to the point that it might be more worthwhile to take a walk on a lovely summer's day \/ night to one of the Yorkville establishments. However, I would recommend the mint chip ice cream without hesitation! It is not the sickly fake green colour that is commonly found in mint chocolate chip ice creams, and it has a refreshing minty taste with real tasting chocolate chips.

As previous reviewers have mentioned, service can be unpredictable. Sometimes you have a really nice server and sometimes it seems as if they couldn't care less whether or not you buy their product.

I also have to comment on the great name - My Favourite! I love it when it say to my friends, ""Let's go to 'My Favourite' for ice cream"", and they respond with a confused, ""Okay, what place is your favourite?"".,, no no, it's called My Favourite!",1,1,2

We were welcomed immediately and brought to one of the few remaining tables. As soon as we sat down we were given complimentary green tea, salad, and miso soup. We had not even opened the menus yet! So far they were starting off very well.

I ordered the shrimp sashimi ($8 - four pieces) and the cucumber roll ($3 - eight pieces). After ordering, we enjoyed our appetizers and both commented on how much we like our salads. Although it was the standard iceberg lettuce that you tend to get at Japanese restaurants, the dressing was different and was really good! Neither of us had the miso soup as we just do not enjoy it in general. 

Our main dishes arrived quickly and we both commented on the size of the rolls - we were not expecting to receive eight pieces - and eight pieces that were stuffed well with a good rice to filling ratio! I like that they brought all four of our dishes at the same time (my friend's two rolls and my sashimi and cucumber roll); however, it was a bit odd that they split up our two orders and put one if each of our orders on two different plates.

The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived, but it filled up pretty quickly. It is a small establishment, so if you are keen to go then you may want a reservation. As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant becomes extremely noisy and it is very difficult to hear your companions speak. I am a young person and had to ask my friends to repeat themselves on numerous occasions. The decor is pretty basic although they do have interesting serving plates. I also liked how there is a very open kitchen (look to your left when you enter) so you can see everything the chefs are doing.

Service was satisfactory. There was a bus boy and it seemed like his only job was to clear plates and fill water glasses. Our glasses were never empty, but he always seemed to be at our table. This could be fixed if they used bigger water glasses!

There were a few things that irritated me about our service that made me feel like the waitress was trying to increase the size of our bill:

1) My friend and I wanted to share a glass of white wine and she clearly explained this to the waitress and asked her to bring a second empty glass. When our waitress came back, she returned with two rather full looking glasses of wine. When we asked if that was one glass that had been split in half, she said she had thought we ordered two glasses of wine.

2) When asked about dish recommendations, she always suggested the more expensive of two options. This happened twice to me, so it seemed a bit suspicious.

3) As other reviewers had mentioned, the waitress recommended a pound of fish per person if you go for ""the big catch"". But, there were no fish that were 1 pound, the smallest was 1.5 pounds. You also hVe to be careful because the prices of the fish are not indicated on the specials chalkboard and you have to ask for them. Prices ranged from about $50 to over $80.

The reason why this restaurant gets three stars rather than two is because of the food. Three of us ordered:

1) Gazpacho ($10) - this was the worst dish of the meal. It was a gazpacho soup with seafood garnish. (1 shrimp, 2 very small scallops, a hunk of white fish, and a few rings of calamari). The calamari was extremely chewy and I personally found it to be inedible. The flavour of the gazpacho base was decent and had a bit if a kick, but I found it to be rather salty and disgustingly oily such that I couldn't finish it. I would never order this dish again... and it came recommended from our waitress. 

2) Tuna Cesar salad ($11) - this was a decent portion and my friend liked it.

3) Clams linguine ($19) - another good sized portion and my friend finished it off, so I think he enjoyed it! It was a bit odd that they did not give him a spoon for the linguine or a side plate for his empty shells and he had to ask for both.

4) Sea diver scallops with a sweet pea pur√©e and a bacon garnish ($29) - my friend loved this dish and said she would definitely order it again. I tried a bite of one of her scallops and would have to agree that they were quite well cooked.

5) Roasted halibut with a zucchini leek side ($30) - this came with two good sized fillets of halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly. The zucchini leek side consisted primarily of olives and capers, and I did not find much zucchini or leek. Might would order this again if I came back to the restaurant.

6) Saut√©ed kale and spinach with roasted garlic ($5) - my friend ordered this as a side to her scallops. I had a bite and I thought that the greens were fine, but rather flavourless. I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try a different side instead. 

The scallops and the halibut were what elevated the restaurant from two stars to three. There are many other interesting restaurants in the area, and new ones are constantly opening.

We arrived around 11 for an early lunch and were brought to our table. The decor is relatively modern, although it is starting to look a bit tired and shabby. Most of the chairs were starting to show quite a bit of wear on the fabric armrests and you could see that there was chipped paint on a number of their cabinets. 

The servers were pleasant and unobtrusive, but I got the sense that they did not exactly go out of their way to cater to the diners. Spoons were dropped, water refills could have been more frequent, etc.

For drinks we just had a coffee and a tea during lunch, and a cappuccino at the end of the meal. Both the coffee and tea arrived with small cookies on the saucer, but the cappuccino did not come with one. It was surprising to me that the green tea came with a biscuit while a cappuccino did not as you would be more likely to expect one with the cappuccino. The cappuccino also took an extremely long time to arrive. The server actually had to go back to check on it because it was so slow to arrive. We were joking that they must be milking their own cows and growing their own beans! I will note that the coffee and tea were both served as pots of coffee and pots of tea, which was appreciated.

We ordered two smoked salmon salads and a small lobster salad without the coconut.

The lobster salad was a decent portion and came with a small lobster-filled samosa. The flavour of the samosa filling was yummy, but the shell was overcooked and rather greasy. The salad is dressed in a very light vinaigrette and comes with some drops of aioli on the plate. I did not like the aioli and would have preferred the dish without it. There are also whole peppercorns pre-sprinkled over top of the salad, so be cautious if you are sensitive to pepper!

The smoked salmon salads were also enjoyed and they came with a bit of caviar sprinkled throughout as well as some large crisps of some sort on top. A lot of fris√©e is used, so if you don't like fris√©e, you may want to avoid this dish. One of my dining companions noted that they thought the salad could use a bit more dressing.

The bathrooms are a bit odd. They are located in the basement and are not wheelchair accessible. If you require wheelchair accessible washrooms, you have to take the elevator up a floor. Once inside the washroom, there are individual stalls with floor-to-ceiling doors and walls. The stalls themselves are quite dim, and I expected a light to come on automatically (I thought they might be motion-sensored), but both my dining companions had the same experience (in both the men's and ladies washrooms).

I ordered a fresh fruit plate with a side of rye toast and my friend ordered a more typical diner meal of eggs over easy with home fries, toast, bacon, and an order of French toast on the side. The fresh fruit plate consisted of a sliced banana, a few orange slices, a chopped gala apple, and some grapes. The grapes weren't the freshest, but I was still satisfied.

Service was fairly bare because there was only one waitress serving the entire place, but she was very pleasant and was happy to answer any questions we had. They forgot to give my friend maple syrup for his French toast, and when we asked for it she apologized and brought it right away.

Overall I would return, but wouldn't necessarily make a special trip to go here.",2,1,0

It wasn't particularly busy as it was brand new, but there was a group there celebrating a wedding event of some sort (it might have been a pre-bachelor party or something). Our server was very chatty, attentive, and answered our questions. One of our party cannot have gluten, so he was very good about checking with the kitchen to see if there were any items that she could have and he addressed all of her concerns.

The menu describes the treats so well that I had a hard time deciding, but ultimately I chose these chocolate banana filled spring rolls that were served with various chocolate and caramel dipping sauces.

The restaurant itself is rather bare bones with limited decorations and plastic chopsticks and cups. The menu is also on the smaller side with fewer options than you may typically expect to find.

My friend ordered the special of the day which was beef teriyaki which came with rice, salad, and a croquette (fried potato ball with meat mixed in). I ordered a cucumber roll and the sunomono salad (seafood, seaweed, cucumber, and a sweet vinegar. The cucumber roll and salad came quickly and I decided to order a second order of the sunomono as the serving size appeared quite small. This second salad also appeared quickly. After waiting for about half an hour without any sign of my friend's food, we decided to inquire about it. It turns out that the waitress had not heard the order for the special of the day, so it had not been prepared. At this stage I was a bit confused about why the waitress had not come to check in on us earlier as we were sitting with three plates of untouched food in front of us for about 25 minutes (I had not touched my food as I was waiting for my friend to receive hers). Her plate came quickly after we fixed this mix up.

The cucumber roll was quite large (8 pieces) with a lot of rice and chunks of cucumber rather than the finely sliced slivers I typically expect. The seafood in the sunomono salad was crab meat and two pieces of shrimp. I found the dressing to be quite salty and one bowl contained considerably more dressing than the other. My friend said her beef teriyaki was good, although it wasn't an outstanding dish.

The smaller restaurant got rather busy during the lunch hour and the server was getting a bit overwhelmed as she was tending to everyone on her own. At one point, the female chef actually emerged from the back to bring out two dishes to patrons. 

Payment is also a bit confusing because some people paid at their tables whereas others went up to the counter to pay. We had to ask for our bill and the waitress asked us to come to the counter to pay.

I asked to substitute tomatoes for the parmesean and for the vinaigrette to be switched to a balsamic and served on the side. The waitress assured me this would be possible and even checked with the chef first before confirming with me.

I was a bit torn about what to do, but after deciding that I did believe this was a hair, I brought it to the cashier to inspect. She called the lady at the deli counter over to examine. This lady was trying to convince me that it wasn't a hair, but was in fact just a stringy bit of spinach. I can understand that spinach sometimes gets stringy when cooked, but this was much too fine, and was slightly curly - like a hair. Eventually this lady brought the deli counter manager over who similarly tried to convince me that it was not a hair. I wasn't being particularly opinionated, but the workers were being quite insistent. After a few minutes, the manager begrudgingly said, ""I really don't think this is a hair, but I guess I'll get you another wrap if you want.""

I was not necessarily looking for another wrap, but an apology certainly would have been nice at the very least.

This is considered to be a high-end grocery store, and to receive that kind of customer service was off-putting. The second that a customer believes there is something wrong with their food (especially if it is unhygienic - like the possible presence of a hair), the correct thing to do would be to apologize and immediately rectify the situation by offering to reimburse the customer, give them a new product, or both. Overall I am very disappointed with the service I received.",9,3,2

We played trampoline dodgeball for a half an hour, and we exhausted after that! We were surprised at how tiring it could be. Then we had the chance to trampoline into their foam pits (filled with foam blocks, NOT shaving cream foam as I initially thought when I heard 'foam pit') and play with their trampoline basketballs. These were entertaining, but the dodgeball was way more fun.

The centre is used by a big mix of people. We were there on a Saturday afternoon, so there were lots of kids running around and birthday parties going on. The centre also has trampoline dodgeball leagues so there were many adults there ready to get their game on!

Dessert - chocolate cake. I was trying to decide between their chocolate cake and the lemon tart, so I asked our waiter for his opinion.

I came with two other diners, one if whom was both vegan and following a gluten-free diet. Our server was very good about informing her which dishes she could have and she went back to the kitchen to ask if she was not sure.

The dishes we ordered included the Thai red curry with tofu (vegan and gluten-free), the curry lunch special of the day (comes with chicken), the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad. 

Everyone really enjoyed their meals, and my two dining companions who had not been to Sukho Thai before both agreed to return; however, there were a few small glitches that prevented Sukho Thai from receiving the full five stars on this review.

1) The lunch curry special of the day cones with a considerably smaller portion of curry than you would receive with the full sized portion. Granted, it does cost less than the full sized dishes; however, when it is promoted as the special of the day, you think you are receiving a deal or good pricing. It would be nice if the lunch menu indicated that the servings were lunch sized portions.

2) One diner ordered the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad as their main course. This dishes arrived about five minutes before the other two dishes, which isn't a big deal because they are cold dishes so don't need to be eaten immediately, but it's still a bit awkward to have them sitting on the table while you wait for the other meals to arrive. These dishes could easily have been held back in the kitchen until the other diners' meals were ready, and then all of the meals could be brought out together.

3) While service was attentive during our meal, we had a hard time tracking down our waitress once she had cleared our plates and we wanted to pay our bills.

Overall it was a satisfying lunch and I will return. I would recommend making reservations before you arrive - you don't want to disappoint your Thai craving if you are faced with a wait!

One bonus of Sukho Thai is that it does take reservations and has incredibly similar (if not identical) dishes to Khao San Road (as they used to be owned by the same people) which does not take reservations and you may encounter a two hour wait for a table there!",1,0,0

First, we had a reservation for 7 but were not seated until about 7:30. That wasn't a problem, as it was a nice night and we sat on a bench outside and perused the menus. Shortly after being seated (just after getting our water glasses filled and before placing our drink order), the hostess popped by and said, ""Just to let you know, we need your table for a reservation at 8:30."" .... ummm excuse me?! We just sat down, and you expect us to finish our meal in an hour?! So I guess we're just going to be rushed through are food and shouldn't expect to be able to order an appetizer, main, and dessert, if we want?! Clearly we were not too pleased with this statement. When one of the waiters passed our table we asked if we could be moved to a different table that we would not be required to vacate in an hour and that was away from the windows (tip: you can feel a draft by the windows, so wouldn't want to sit near them in the winter). This waiter went off to check for us. Then a different waiter appeared to take our drink order and we explained our request. At this point, someone (who I assume was one of the managers) stuck his head in and briskly told us that things were taken care of and we would not have to leave by 8:30. Great! We were finally able to enjoy our evening. A further note on the service - after the initial rocky start to our meal, it would have been nice if the manager had checked in on us again later to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, but alas, that did not occur.

Decor: refined casual - think gold framed pictures, accents of pastel colours, and a certain feminine flare to the room. It's definitely more elegant in appearance than Khao San Road, Sukho Thai, Pai, or Sabai Sabai.

Food: matching the decor, also more refined than any of the chef's other restaurants. I wanted to order a tea to drink, but they didn't have any hot water yet... weird. Rather than make this statement for every dish, I'm just going to say outright that I think the dishes are overpriced. Yes, they are unique, but I thought everything was overpriced considering the serving size (except the mussels). We ordered:

1) Mun Tawt Ruammit ($9) - taro root, sweet potato, and zucchini chips sprinkled with Tom yum spices. Personally I didn't taste much of the Tom yum and actually found them to be quite salty. 

2) Pad Buab Jae ($10) - Sliced gourd with garlic and basil. I really enjoyed this dish. There are many layers to the flavour of this dish with a strong smokey element. We both agreed that we would have preferred it had the gourd been crunchy or crispy. 

3) Hoi Nung Ta Krai ($14) - Roasted mussels with lemongrass broth. Phenomenal. So delicious and most definitely worth the price! And the way it is served is just gorgeous! This was by far my favourite dish. I just kept going back for more!

4) Khao Yum ($24) - this is essentially a flavoured rice dish. Yes, it's gorgeous and includes some interesting components (pomelo, kaffir lime, and fried chili to list a few), but it's maybe one and a half cups of rice total and maybe 1-2 tbsp of each seasoning. I'm glad I ordered it once for the photo, but I wouldn't order it again. The waiter was right though - the photo does turn out better with flash!


5) Dessert ($15) - they only had one dessert option on the night that we went, and it was a fruit platter. This consisted of two wedges of pomelo, four lychees, two mangosteens, and about 1\/4 of a mango. The pomelo was so fresh and delicious, but I'm biased because pomelo is quite possibly my favourite fruit and it has been out of season for awhile, so I'm always happy to get some. Save your money on dessert and grab something special elsewhere.

Although overpriced, I will still return because the food was yummy, and I hope they have the kinks (in the service and the hot water) worked out by then!",3,0,2

We ordered one of their trios of appetizers as a starter - the bean\/grain salad, the beets, and the kale hummus. The beets were delicious, perfectly cooked - not too hard or too mushy. The beans \/ grains dish has a bit of an Indian curry flavour to it, so caution if you don't like that taste. I personally didn't like the kale hummus. I found it to be too bitter tasting, but my dining companion really liked it. I ordered the mixed greens salad and some of the Baby greens were wilty. The pasta was a quite a large serving. More than enough to take home leftovers and have a full meal the next day.

There isn't much ambiance to this place. It kind of looks like an old run down bar that they've converted into a restaurant. On the plus side, they do accept American Express! 

They have lots of options for people with all sorts of tastes and the menu is well labeled with dietary options for any type of diet.

We arrived around noon and the restaurant was about 50% full. I started to notice that it got pretty busy with the lunch crowd around 12:30, so unless you're planning on doing take out, it might be a good idea to arrive a bit earlier so you can grab a table.

Our cashier was a bit clueless. My friend asked if they had cheddar cheese available as all she wanted was cheese slices on toast. The cashier said that they did have cheddar cheese, but said she needed to ask how to ring in the order. We found this a bit odd because it clearly says on their menu that options include bread for $1 and cheese for $2. So wouldn't cheese and toast qualify as those two options? Our cashier asked another server and the server indicated that they did not actually have cheddar cheese. Then it took our server three attempts to accurately confirm our order - at one point she actually thought that we had also ordered an avocado sandwich.

They have an extensive menu with a number of healthy options available. I really liked how there are lots of combos to choose from and lots of ways to customize your meal. We both selected the red lentil soup, which was one of their two soups of the day (the other was butternut squash). The soup is just over $5 and comes with two halves of bread (choice of white, whole wheat, and multigrain) and little container of packaged butter on the side. The soup was quite good; however, it was rather chunky as the lentils are barely (if at all) pur√©ed. I prefer my lentil soups to be smoother, but this is a matter of personal preference. I noticed that there were other vegetables in the soup too like carrots, onions, and tomatoes. It was also noted that the soup is vegan.

The restaurant is quite large. It is clean, spacious, modern, and dimly lit. They have both an AYCE menu (I believe around $19-20) as well as an a la carte option. We decided to order a la carte as we were a small group and not particularly hungry. The menu also has a number of unique rolls and dishes that you would not necessarily find at typical sushi bars. I ordered the following dishes:

1) Fushimi Salad ($3.5 - assorted seafood, cucumber, green onion, with homemade sauce) - the only seafood I found was bits if calamari, and it was only small pieces of tentacles, not the nice smooth pieces if the squid's body. Given that the menu said 'assorted seafood' I was also hoping for some shrimp or crabmeat, but alas, did not have any. The dressing had a bit of a kick to it, was rather salty, and there was just too much dressing - the cucumbers were drenched! I wouldn't order this dish again.

2) Shrimp Asparagus ($5 - cooked shrimp and asparagus with yuzu miso sauce) - this was four pieces of shrimp settled upon four spears of cooked asparagus. I would order this dish again and it was my favourite of the night.

3) Eggplant Roll ($4, 4 pieces - eggplant, lettuce, cucumber, with house sauce) - warning: the eggplant is tempura eggplant! I wish the menu had said this as I do not like tempura and would not have ordered this dish had I known. Nevertheless, I had one piece.

4) Cucumber Roll - because I did not like the eggplant roll, I decided to order a standard cucumber roll as it was a dish where I knew I would not be surprised with tempura again! It was a typical cucumber roll, although I found that there was too much rice (same with the eggplant roll).

My friends also enjoyed the dishes that they had ordered. The serving sizes are quite generous here and everything is presented artfully. A dish of wasabi and ginger was brought to the table before we had even ordered. I didn't particularly like this as it meant that these items were not freshly served, and these were communal dishes meant to be shared by everyone at the table.

I am struggling with what to say regarding the service. Our server was very sweet and brought water to the table immediately. Although green tea was complimentary, you had to ask for it, and it was served in typical coffee mugs, not the little green tea cups. There were definitely some language issues with our server as she was not able to explain what was in the fushimi salad and I had asked for the house sauce on my eggplant roll to come on the side, but when she brought it to the table, she explained that she had forgotten and asked if I wanted a new roll. It was hard to turn down the roll once it had already come to the table. In addition I was surprised that she didn't ask about the fact that I had only eaten one of the four pieces of the eggplant roll. It would have been appreciated if she had asked and realized that I did not like the dish and then removed it from the bill. 

Although there were a few snags in my meal, this is a restaurant I would come back to in order to try some of their other dishes.

It's a small venue with only about a handful of table. Certainly not an ideal place for groups, and better suited to tables of 2-4 diners. They have a partially open kitchen so the four seats at the bar overlook the chefs. As a result, or possibly due to the building itself, the ventilation is very poor here causing the room to be really warm - to the point that they had to open to front door to cool things down. This meant that we had to fluctuate between asking for the door to be opened and closed throughout our meal.

The servers are definitely still learning the menu \/ the lay of the restaurant. I started as the first person to make my order and after I ordered two dishes, the server stopped me to describe what an appropriate amount of food was for our table for four and what she would suggest. Really, this should have happened when we were all initially seated and before we started to peruse the menu. The first dish I ordered was from the ""small"" section and it was a plate of cinnamon roasted beets with preserved lemon. When I asked for it, she remarked the the dish was a lot of beets! Our table laughed when we received the plate because in actuality it was quite small and it would be easy enough for someone to eat on their own. You could really taste the cinnamon and I did not detect the preserved lemon. Also, although not described on the menu, it comes on top of a layer of yogurt \/ cream - just in case you don't eat dairy (I don't). Another dish we ordered was the eggplant dip. I didn't particularly like it. It was more like a macerated bruschetta with bits of eggplant too (the tomato flavour came out more though) and a Seasoning that I did not particularly like. For $10, it was a tiny portion which I thought was overpriced. 

Originally, we ordered two tagines, two of the ""small"" dishes, and three of the ""sides"" (steamed carrot salad with raisins, couscous, and horchata - a fried buttery biscuit). This was way too much food and we canceled the second tagine after we could barely finish the first.

I came here after work with a few coworkers, expecting since it's still the weekend it would be pretty busy (said a co-worker who was raving about this place).

The wait was about 30 mins, then the line grew as we were waiting for our table. We ordered:
- Soyu Ramen (extra chasiu)
- 2 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and egg)
- 1 Pork belly bowl
- 4 drinks
total is around $50

Since this was the first time trying a Ramen spot besides my own mothers, I decided why not, since one of my co-workers have been asking all of us to go everyday at work. We entered the restaurant after the wait and the table are really packed close together (so it's like we're eating the table next to us). The people in line are watching other people eat, it's kind of awkward.

I tried my ramen, it was good but not the greatest (I told him, the hype he was giving this restaurant was not necessary anymore). The chasiu was weird, it was disintegrating in my soup. It was mostly melty, fatty, and I found it pointless to get extra. 

My love got so sick from this place, he was perfectly fine, until that night. He was sweating and grabbing a fever, everything came out from both ends for a couple of days. He's afraid to try Ramen again :(",0,0,0

Oh lee's sandwiches, how you made bomb bbq pork bahn mi's for me in the past. What did you do to me last night :( 

I usually go to lee's sandwiches off the the 215 and eastern, but since I was near the strip, I decided to stop to this one -_-"" I should have gotten pho instead.

I ordered 2 bbq pork bahn mi, a special combination bahn mi, and a lee's coffee. The cost is around $18. I asked the cashier what was in the special combination bahn mi and he had no clue, he was nice enough to ask someone to tell us what's inside there (head cheese, jabon, pate), well I never had any of those interesting meats (I did not like the after taste, I'll stick to bbq pork). My love and I decided to go with the usual but try something different as well. We both took a bite of the special combination (props for those who can handle this taste), with the bread scraping against my gums and ripping my skin off, I already knew my bahn mi was not  going to be good.

I usually expect my bread to my bite-able, but no. BBQ pork had a off putting taste to it. I don't know, I felt like I had food poisoning after an hour of eating this meal. I will attempt to eat at my usual spot and let you know how it goes, but as for lee's in china town. I do not recommend.",0,1,0

After reading tons of yelp reviews, I had to try this place out. I ordered a medium caramelizer and my babe ordered a medium caramelizer freeze. Both similar in taste just his had ice particles and mine was over ice.

I just have to say the staff is SUPER friendly. Their customer service is excellent ! The lady that helped us at the drive thru asked if this was our first time and excitedly we said yes. Her words of awsomeness ""Oh nice, well welcome! & if you try this and it doesn't taste good, let me know and we will find something that you like"".

The buffet was for two people at the price of $83 and some change. There is such variety when first stepping into the buffet.

The buffet highlight for me was the fresh juices and dessert. The food was good, I rather settle for a buffet a boulder station for cheaper, than to go here again. The food here was a little bland and I didn't really enjoy most of it. They do have a tapas style going for some of the food selections so you can try most of the items they have to offer, but it was missing something -flavor. I decided to try this place out due to the numerous reviews on how great this place is, I would recommend it for you to try it at least once (the seafood was awesome).

I've wanted to try a new ramen place, since Monta is always packed and has wait times over 45mins. I found this place with the help of some yelpers. I decided I can't go wrong with a place that offers ramen and appetizers.

I ordered:
- Takoyaki
- Tonkatsu
- 1 Soyu Ramen (garlic chips and extra chasiu)
- 1 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and corn)
- 3 Calpico drinks
- 1 Sprite
total about $40

Since i've only tried Monta and (my moms ramen), I'll be comparing the two (mom already wins). 

I LOVE takoyaki and this place makes it so good, it's crisp on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. The tonkatsu made with a cabbage salad and the tonkatsu sauce on the side, which was cooked to perfection. The tonkatsu was thick and crispy on the outside with the tender juicy pork on the inside. It was delicious.

When the ramen arrived the noodles were perfect, the soup was super flavorful and didn't need to add additional salt or soy sauce to it. Compared to monta's chasiu, this one is meaty in the middle and melt in your mouth on the sides (which is how it's suppose to be). I didn't enjoy the chasiu at Monta because it was like eating boiled fat (it was slippery, melty, and gooey). 

If you want incredible ramen, come here. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. This small ramen restaurant should be deemed the best. The best thing is, it didn't make my love sick, he got so sick at Monta, he was scared to try Ramen again.",1,0,0

Mercredi soir au d√©but d√©cembre 19h30. La grosse pancarte sur la 40 qui annon√ßait le sp√©cial 2 pour 22 avait attir√© mon attention. Alors, cherchant une place pas cher pour manger, nous avons d√©cid√© d'aller l√†-bas...ERREUR. Premi√®rement, je sais que ce n'est pas la faute au resto mais il est quand m√™me difficile de trouver l'endroit en auto. Ce n'est pas trop bien expliqu√©. 
Bref, nous rentrons l√†, le resto √† quelques clients...genre une quinzaine. L'h√¥te hyper amicale nous a placer sur une banquette. Alors, je regarde le menu de pauvre, 2 pour 22, et bien il n'√©tait pas trop attrayant.

 Et il y avait les autres plats....les fruits de mer avec p√¢tes m'attrayait. Et mon amie a d√©cid√© de me suivre, mais avec la table d'h√¥te. Elle a pris un tartare au saumon et moi les p√¢tes aux fruits de mer. Le serveur a amen√© la soupe de mon amie. Quelques minutes plus tard, le serveur est venu me demand√© si c'est bel et bien les p√¢tes avec fruits de mer et non celui de crevettes, p√©toncles et champignon. Je reconfirme mon plat de fruits de mer. En attendant nos plats, on a demand√© du pain...c'√©tait des petites baguettes...d√ªr au bout, mais chaude et moelleuse au milieu. Alors on re√ßoit nos plats. La lumi√®re est tr√®s tamis√©, alors je ne voyais pas bien le plat et j'avais faim. Apr√®s que j'ai mis du parmesan fourni par le serveur  et poivre moulu de tavle(le serveur nous a pas dit s'il y avait du poivre frais), je me rends compte que ce n'est pas le plat de fruit de mer...mais bien celui fe crevettes et champignons. J'y ai goutt√©..un peu trop de cr√®me √† mon go√ªt et je voulais mes p√¢tes aux fruits de mer...alors obliger de dire au serveur et d'attendre une quinzaine de minutes pour qu'on me fasse le plat que j'ai demand√© 2 fois...En attendant, je mangeais les frites de mon amie hehehe...elles √©taient sec et dur.

Elle me dis que son saumon du tartare go√ªte bizarre. Je go√ªte et effectivement..un go√ªt de poisson cuit avec du citron. Je regarde donc avec la lumi√®re de mon cell et effectivement le saumon √©tait rose cuit. √áa veut dire que le tartare n'√©tait pas frais et √† s√ªrement pass√© des heures marin√© dans le citron...Le serveur a √©t√© mis au courant et a offert √† mon amie si elle voulait autre chose ..le non a √©t√© sa r√©ponse.

Pour cette √©valuation, je vais diviser les endroits visit√© dans l'h√¥pital. 

LES URGENCES: C'√©tait la premi√®re fois que j'y allais √† ses Urgences. Un peu compliqu√© de s'y retrouver dans le processus d'inscription et de triage. Premi√®rement, il faut prendre un num√©ro, comme dans le comptoir √† charcuterie dans une √©picerie. Ensuite, on passe au triage avec un gentil infirmier. Apr√®s, c'est l'inscription, avec une madame qui on dirait est toujours occup√© avec son ordi. Cela peut prendre 10 minutes avant qu'elle se rend compte qu'il y a quelqu'un assis sur son bureau devant elle. Soyez chanceux, qu'une fois qu'on vous appelle, le docteur et l'infirmi√®re font les tests tr√®s rapidement. Nous n'avons pas besoin d'attendre une autre heure pour voir le docteur dans la salle de consultation. Pr√©voyez un bon deux heures pour avoir les r√©sultats d'examens.

LE BISTRO DU REZ-DE-CHAUSS√âE: Il est propre, il sent bon. Il y a un beau menu du jour. Il y a quelques petits articles d√©j√† pr√©parer que nous pouvons acheter et c'est un mini d√©panneur. Il y a une vingtaine de places assises. Le staff tr√®s gentil. J'ai √©t√© acheter un th√©, un muffin et un caf√© (pour ma maman). J'ai pu regarder le menu. Simple. Par contre un trio deux hot-dogs, frites et boisson √† 10-12$, cela devient cher. En m√™me temps, apr√®s avoir vu la caf√©t√©ria du bas, on pr√©f√®re payer le prix. En plus, le bistro est ouvert pas mal toute la journ√©e et ce jusqu'√† 21h.

LA CAF√âT√âRIA DU SOUS-SOL: Une vrai caf√©t√©ria douteuse d'h√¥pital. Ouf le menu du jour. Une soupe au l√©gume avec hamburger. Ma m√®re a manger cela. Je n'ai jamais vu un burger aussi d√©go√ªtant. Certes, le prix n'est pas cher. La station des condiments de burger fait peur et n'a pas l'air propre.

The decor is similar, the menu items are similar and the waitresses look similar, except these ones wear more modest pencil skirts, as opposed to the mini skirts that Moxie's favours. 

That said, I don't think I have ever had as good a meal in a Moxie's. 

I was having a HUGE craving for grilled cheese. I couldn't get it out of my head! So I went onto Yelp and typed in grilled cheese and this place came up as being open and not too far away. 

So off we went to the Shops at Don Mills. I've never been to the Shops at Don Mills before, although I have heard of it many times. I'd be interested to come back sometime when stores are open, but in the meantime, into Joey we went. That sounded funny....

Anyway, we ordered calamari appetizer and drinks (beer and a cocktail). The calamari itself was alright, but I really liked the asparagus on top and the aioli. 

Problems arose in terms of the drinks. The waiter recommended the bellini, but then it turned out that the slush machine was umm....slushing. I had to wait until after my meal came to get the bellini, but the waiter was very apologetic and gave regular updates to the progress. It wasn't a huge deal, but I can't help but take points off. When you are paying $60 for two peoples' dinner, you don't really have a choice, right??

My husband ordered a simple caesar salad, which was good, but basic...that's not their fault, that's just what caesars are. I liked the freshly grated parmesan cheese on top though. Better than the powdery stuff that comes from a jar.

Now...my sandwich. I of course ordered their grilled cheese, but this is not any grilled cheese, it is a LOBSTER grilled cheese...oh yes....oh yes....

The bread was buttery and crispy, the cheese perfectly melted and most importantly, it did not overpower the lobster. You could taste the lobster, which was in big chunks in the sandwich. It was delicious. 

The sandwich comes with a large helping of their ""skinny fries"", which are similar to McDonald's fries, but less salty, thank God! 

I NEED to have this grilled cheese again and this place is open late nightly, so good to keep in mind, next time I get a grilled cheese craving. The service is good, prices a little steep, but to be expected in the area. Next time I think I'll order the soup with the sandwich, because I feel like it will work more nicely together.

Usually we just order delivery and they are quite fast and polite.
I have tried several things from the menu and quite liked them all, although i would avoid anything with bamboo shoots in it. They are tough and sharp!

I went with my sister and husband and we were sat down in the small space. Ethiopian is eaten with your hands, so I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. The bathroom is upstairs where there is another upper part of the restaurant and a small bar. 

The bathroom was clean, although I did notice a cockroach trap in the corner. I want to specify that the washroom was perfectly clean and I never saw any bugs. It was mildly disconcerting, but you'd probably be hard pressed to find any restaurant in downtown without a stray roach SOMEWHERE kicking around in it. Let's just be real!

Anyway, myself and my sister ordered a combo dish of a small portion of all of their veggie options, for two. My husband ordered their ""special"",which was a chicken dish, served with a whole, hard boiled egg.

Our meals arrived and my sister and my meal, was served on a large platter, with spoonfuls of the various dishes all around and a small salad in the middle. Certain parts were better than others, but that's probably a personal preference and nothing was bad. Just good and GOODER (yeah, I KNOW it's not a word).

The prices were also extremely reasonable. The portions of injera (the flat bread you eat the food with) were large and we were given 2 pieces each. That's ALL you would need, but if you're REALLY hungry, the food is served on a large piece of it, so you can literally eat your plate. 

Those are the good things. Now onto the not so good things.

The service was a little lacking. We ordered their special coffee at the beginning of the meal, as requested in the menu, only to be told they were not serving it anymore that day. We were there at around 8:30 and the restaurant closes at 11pm, according to their website. Why was it no longer being served??

Our waitress seemed sort of displeased with us being there in general. She was not very friendly. She avoided eye contact with us most of the night, which made it really hard to get her attention to get the bill and to pay. 

My sister and I were sitting across from each other and when our food was served our injera was on one plate. I asked if I could have another plate, to put my injera on and I got the dirtiest look you could imagine and the waitress turned on her heel without a word. She did get us a plate though. 

Normally, this type of service would be a real turn-off, but honestly the food was so damn good and the prices so damn good, I'm not even going to let it deter me!

YumTum\/ Toronto Underground Market is a food fair. You have to pay a cover and then you have access to various ""vendors\/chefs"" selling food for reasonable prices. So where is the problem? The problem is that it's not a reasonable cost. 

Online the cost is now $22.60\/person PLUS a $2.50 service charge (WTF??!?). So basically you're looking at about $50 for two people...since you're probably not going alone.

Once in, each serving (depending on what it is, costs around $4-$5 on average). You're probably going to want to eat more than two things, since you're there, but lets say you're being cheap and you eat $10 worth of food. Now, for two people, you have spent $70....on a sampling of food, which may be good, but better be dipped in gold for that cost!

Other accounts tell me that this place is sort of turning into another Taste of the Danforth...which used to be awesome...and now it SO crowded, it's totally not enjoyable. So be prepared to wait in lines. 

This event sounds like it has turned into a total racket. Someone is racking in the dough. I would LOVE to support local food vendors and chefs, but it won't be like this. If it was $20 and you got tickets towards vendors of your choice (got to choose 4 samples, for example), or was cheaper, it would make more sense to me. This doesn't feel like it's supporting chefs anymore though. Feels like a money-grab.

Let's see what else...parking is hard to come by...according to Yum Tum's website and so they provide a shuttle bus that runs EVERY THIRTY MINUTES! 

For $70+ I can go and get a nice, sit down dinner with my husband...parking outside the door and that's what I'll be doing this Saturday. Have fun paying $70 for a few nibbles everyone!",13,5,7

But I'll keep this review about the actual theatre. People with ""perfect pitch"" below are complaining about the mic problems and I hate to admit that she is not only humble, but correct in this case. There was one small mic problem that last for a couple of seconds in Rocky. 

That said, this is a smaller-scale community theatre, not Mirvish productions. They have small, but passionate casts, performing larger than life productions. Sadly, once and awhile someone's voice gets a little pitchy, or a mic goes out. Since SOME people have such perfect voices, I DO hope they audition for future performances, because if you have perfect pitch, you should really be sharing your gift with the world. *ahem*

Where was I?

RIGHT, the actual THEATRE.

Really, I wish I could be giving this theatre a 3-1\/2 star rating.  The pros - There are no bad seats in the whole place!  Both times I have gone I have had what many people would consider the worst seats in the house. Once right in the front and once right in the back (corner no less).  When you have seats in the front, you are basically ON the stage. The actors come and interact with you and it's tonnes of fun. In the back you can see EVERYTHING and the peoples' reactions. Both seats were good. BUT the physical seats themselves leave something to be desired. THey are literally metal, folding chairs with patio furniture cushions on them. They are set on wooden risers and are very close together with narrow walking paths. 

The other major problem are their bathrooms. I've obviously only seen the women's washroom though. The women's washroom has one two stalls in it, both of which are VERY small. Once you have to squeeze by an old, gross standing shower (?) to get to. The shower's sliding doors are only mostly closed, revealing garbage that has been piled up there...not like food garbage, but old pieces of crap, boxes and stuff. 

Staff have all be helpful and polite when we have gone and it's old and rickety, but works. That said, I feel like a lot of these people performing are local actors\/musicians, just trying to make it, or break into the business and so if the money goes to them, instead of fixing the theatre up a bit, I can understand that.

Neither time I went, did those chairs, or bathrooms take away from the great time I had. Go with a light heart and an open-mind and you will have an excellent time.",2,1,0
nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ,Katherine,WnUttoJffplgWaQGR2J2Xw,"""Cafe Presse""",3,04-11-2012,"A friend and I were looking for a place to eat before a show at the Lower Ossington Theatre. We wanted Lobretto Pizza, but the girl on the phone there said that at 6:30 we wouldn't have a problem getting a table and that turned out to be a lie, so we popped in a couple doors down to this place.

We glanced at the menu and it seemed alright, so we went for it. The host warned us that we needed to like meat and he was not kidding. Everything on the menu had meat.

The menu consists of a lot of pub faire, but at hugely inflated prices. The atmosphere, unlike what you would expect from a ""tavern"" was not dark and cozy, but white and as my friend described ""sort of like a 1950s bathroom"". It had white tile walls and white floors and a sort of mirrored panel across the walls...so yeah a bit bathroom-like. I guess to make it ""saintly""? 

My friend ordered their sandwich of the day, which was a BLT and fries. I have recently given up beef, which limited my choices considerably, so I got the fried chicken. I should mention that the menu includes exactly ZERO explanation of what any of the dishes are. The fried chicken simply says, ""fried chicken"". It did not explain that this came with mashed potatoes and saut√©ed spinach (or kale??) with it. Potatoes were good, but had big chunks of bacon in them. That should probably be mentioned, since if anyone doesn't eat pork, I don't think it would occur to them to ask the waiter(ess) if their fried chicken includes bacon. 

Food was alright. I liked my friend's sandwich better than my dish and her fries were good.  My meal was exactly as it said. No bells and whistles. I sort of felt like for $20 that chicken should have had some twist to it, or something special, but not really. It was chicken, much like you might receive from KFC, but marginally better (less greasy and salty). 

The spinach was VERY salty tasting. 

Service was good and everyone there was very nice. Overall it's a fine place, but nothing special and I think they charge too much for average food, with nothing special about it. Whenever I go back to the area, I'm going to try something else. I feel like it's not worth a second try, though it was fine for one try.",0,0,1

When we drove up to it I recognized it from driving by, but had never been in. The lineup encouraged me that I was at a good place.

Service was fast and friendly. I got a cheeseburger and onion rings. They gave me a number and when I was called up, I chose what to put on my burger. 

Now, let's get down to the nitty gritty.

First of all, the toppings are VERY limited. Onions or saut√©ed onions, pickles, tomato, ketchup, mayo, mustard, relish...I didn't even see lettuce, unless it was hiding in the back. 

The burger was large, but nothing special. It wasn't like some fantastic, juicy, seasoned meat or anything. Just a basic burger. 

The bun was too soft and got soggy really fast. I mean SOGGY! It had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of. The onion rings were your basic frozen onion rings...same with the fries. They weren't hand-battered, or homemade...just standard fare. 

Honestly, NOTHING about this place warranted the rave reviews from my colleagues and the only thing I could glean from hearing them talk, was that this place has been around Scarborough forever and it's just a staple. You go here based on tradition. 

Well, sadly that's not enough of a reason for me to give this a good review. It's also not enough of a reason for me to bother recommending this place. Unless this place has some near and dear meaning in your heart, Hero Burger makes a WAY better burger. I guess if you want your burger made with ""love and memories"" come to this place. I want my burger made with juicy meat, lots of veggies and some sort of mayo-based sauce! If you cannot deliver, I am not interested. Johnny's did not deliver for me on this one!

Perhaps my expectations were high, seeing as this place has been featured on shows and is number one for grilled cheese on BlogTO. 

I had the Grilled Motzy and my husband had the Black Jack. We also had soup, which was tomato and pretty basic. 

Both of our sandwiches were good. I'd say my husband's was a little more sophisticated in taste. Mine felt like the pesto really overwhelmed any other flavours. It wasn't unpleasant, but I WAS wanting a grilled cheese. 

The sandwiches are served in baskets, with some ripple chips and a slice of pickle...really good pickles actually. Chips are just chips. If these guys want to take things up a notch they should charge a dollar or two extra and consider creating a more interesting\/homemade side dish. What??! I don't know, I haven't thought that far ahead. People will pay extra for good and creative side dishes that really add to meals though, right??

Oh and in response to people who were commenting that the sandwiches are really greasy, I didn;t find that at all! There was no grease gathering at the bottom of the paper in the basket and my fingers stayed relatively clean! Maybe they changed?? Or maybe some people are nuts...I mean it IS grilled cheese, it's not ....umm.....lettuce. 

I wasn't willing to leave without trying ONE last item...but we were full. I ordered a sandwich that's name I don't remember, but it was basically cheese, bacon and mushrooms. The to go sandwiches are in plastic boxes with lids. Great if you want to bring it to work the next day, or something.

In our case I split the sandwich in half and served it with my own soup the next day for dinner. This was definitely more of a traditional grilled cheese, but again, I found the bacon to be a little overpowering. Still good...my soup was heads and tails better though. 

Not sure I would bother with the soup here again. I liked everything I had, but nothing compared with the lobster grilled cheese I had the Joey's. The flavours were perfect in that sandwich!

THere are a lot of other options to try and everything was very good. I think that if you're in the area and want a sandwich that costs the same as Subway, but is more creative and more delicious, this is a great choice!

Problems: First of all, I did NOT sign up for karaoke. We sat AWAY from all of that to avoid it, but the problem was that they have speakers over all the tables, regardless of where you are and they were LOUD! Secondly, the woman singing, who, from what we could gauge over the speakers, worked here, was NOT a good singer.

The burgers are good, very large and filling and I like the grilled mushrooms as a topping. Where they fall short: no specialty sauces (just basic mayo) and no combos! This I find very strange. You have to order everything separately. It seems like a little thing to make a combo!

I liked the service though. The woman taking our order told me that only one fry would work or two people and she was right. I appreciated the heads up! But I wish they had some more variety of products.

I switched jobs and stopped working close by and didn't come back for years. I'm not kidding, I was always sad about that. It just wasn't close! 

Well, I happened to be in the area a few nights ago and of course, it only made sense to go back. It was exactly as I remembered it....AMAZING! The food is SO excellent here and the service is just amazingly quick. We got our food in I'd say under five minutes! Our water glasses were always full and the portions are so large, you can easily make one meal stretch to two. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to go back! 

So why the loss of one star? 

Well...this is a tricky one. You see, the service was great, BUT there was probably one of the rudest and most annoying families I have ever encountered at a restaurant in my life...other than the time I was eating at a Kelsey's and a kid was literally running circles around the restaurant screaming and when I quietly asked the parents if they could quiet their child the dad told me to f-off, in front of his three year old...because they were celebrating a ""religious occasion""....right, where was I? Yes, so this family was divided so that the approx 2 year old was sitting farthest away from all parents, in a booster seat and shouting and screeching loudly, while banging a spoon against the table. The other two yong boys, who appeared to be acting as the caregivers, where egging him on, trying to make him scream louder. The waiter took care of the spoon, by quietly taking away the metal one and replacing it with a plastic one, but the kid kept shouting.

Now, I want to be clear. I don't blame the restaurant for bad parenting. I understand that this is a tricky situation. You don't want to single out any of your guests and lose business. But here's the thing. There were four adults there that you might lose business from, vs. the other 10-12 adults you very well could lose business from, because people were visibly upset with this kid and his parents. 

The other thing is that there was an easy solution. Half of the restaurant, on the other side of the building, was not being used, simply because there were not enough patrons to require it. Having a waiter approach the family and politely offer them a table in that room, as it would allow their child to continue being a bit nosier, would both get rid of them AND probably show them that they need to control their terrible offspring. 

As it was, nothing was resolved and we did not stick around for dessert. As we were leaving, a man sitting across from the family was looking like he might burst into flames. I asked if it was annoying enough for him and he shock his head and loudly said, ""I'm going to f-ing LOSE it."" So yeah...may want to take care of that situation. Having your patrons enjoy their time is SO important to their experience.

I had tiger shrimp as an appetizer. It came with a delicious peanut sauce. This was the same for the chicken. They were actually very good. My sister had spring rolls and she said they were alright, nothing special. We all got pad thai, however my sister got the vegetarian pad thai, while myself and my husband got the chicken pad thai. It was good, but pretty comparable to pad thai I've had....well, just about everywhere. The desserts were also alright. There was a special on drinks. Their signature Tiger beers were only $4 and they had excellent margaritas for $6. That was probably my favorite part of the meal.

So I have been hearing about Pizzeria Libretto for ages and dying to try it and I finally got my chance. We went all out, so I'll go through the stuff I sampled.

We shared an arugula salad with walnuts and pears. Not a huge salad, given the $9 price tag, but was a really good salad. We also tried the ricotta gnocchi fritti. This was disappointing. They basically looked and tasted like tator tots with a sour cream and chive ""sauce"". I don't know where the ricotta comes into play, but these were nothing special, a small portion and not great in general. 

NOW for the reason people come to this place. The pizzas. I had the Libretto Margherita (which is $4 more than the regular margherita, presumably because they use buffalo mozzarella, or so it is alluded to on the menu). My husband got the house-made sausage pizza.

These pizzas were excellent. Both reminiscent of what you might find in Italy, very thin, but with perfect crust. I usually go with the margherita, because it's classic and not too many bells and whistles, but I had a piece of my husband's and it was excellent! I'm not usually a sausage fan (no pun intended), but this was really good. 

Finally, we split their sfingi, which is basically donut holes in cinnamon-sugar and with a strawberry sauce, caramel sauce or lemon sauce to dip them in. The donuts were nothing special. Honestly, I've had better at Tim Horton's. The sauces added a little something, but not enough to make this something I would order again. The lemon was good, husband liked the strawberry...the caramel, which you would think would be great with donuts, tasted burnt...to the point where it was inedible. 

So basically, if you come for the pizza, you're good to go. This place does that really well..everything else...skip it. There are so many awesome little places in the area, I would just get the pizza and go get dessert somewhere else. 

That said, because this place IS a pizzeria, I give it 4 stars, because they do the thing they're supposed to, well!",0,1,0

Still, I vowed I would try those bagels. I had heard such good things. I wondered if all my life I was merely eating bread, and not experiencing true bagel deliciousness! 

Finally, I made a special trip, on the weekend to Bagel World JUST for those bagels...and what a disappointment. We got four bagels: 2 plain and 2 ""everything"". We sampled the plain one first...they were bland and tasteless, with no crispness on the outside and softness on the inside, like I have come to expect from a good bagel. They were basically just huge hunks of dough. They were expensive, although large, but I didn't finish mine. I nibbled the everything bagel and was equally disappointed. In the end I had to throw them out. They sat there on my counter for days, before it finally became clear that no matter how hungry I got, I wasn't going to bother.

SO what happened? A bad batch? Maybe I hyped them up too much? Who knows! All I know is that I can't figure out where the rav reviews come from. I wanted to like them so badly...and they were just bleh. Oh well, now I won't have to make any more special trips to get those bagels any longer.",2,1,2

This cafe, which appears quite new, is a great alternative to Starbucks. 

Close your mouths, I know I just committed a crime (ALTERNATIVE to STARBUCKS??!?!) I LOVE Starbucks, but you know every time you go there, there are never any seats, because I swear, they hire people to sit there from 7am till 11pm on their Macbooks. 

Anyway, this place has no lack of seating. THere are several levels of pretty, clean white tables and booths, with comfy, modern, grey chairs.

In-between the booths are walls, which are mirrored, but have TVs in them as well...built into them! They look all futuristic and crap! 

Of course their are tributes to Ms. Monroe, but they're not slapping you in the face and you can certainly go here without feeling like you need to be obsessed. 

The menu for drinks is similar to what you find at Starbucks...they have cafe mochas and creme brule lattes and caramel lattes, etc. I didn't find their drinks quite as good as Starbucks' though. They were good, don't get me wrong, but Starbucks drinks really are above and beyond....SOOO minus one star.

BUT they have the cafe portion, which serves some cheesecakes and cupcakes and the like. I really enjoyed my cupcake actually, even though it was pretty pricey. The cakes look good, but the portions are pretty small, given the prices. It would be nice if they served more savory treats as well. I hadn't had lunch, so I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and I was given a good bagel, but packets of cream cheese...that's sort of chintzy in a place which looks as classy...sorry if I can't even get the same service in bagels as Tim Horton's??! Come on now! 

The service was polite, but a little slow and my friend commented that she had some questions about their tea selection (whether the herbal teas were caffeinated or not) and the girl working their had no idea. 

SOOO even though I really liked this place and would totally come back for a treat (great place if you want to sit and chat over coffee), it loses that one star.

nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ,Katherine,FdRZWQ8TVuKANFXcI1Do7Q,"""Sally Beauty Supply""",5,20-10-2012,"So I've given myself a rule that I'm going to a place at least twice before I give it a review. This is because in the past I have been going to places, been pretty pleased, written stellar reviews and then gone back and been less than pleased...and having to awkwardly revise those great reviews. 

I have been to a few different locations of Civello before and been quite happy, but I have found it to be on the expensive side and it's also a bit out of the way for me, so that led me to begin the search for another place. I did get my wedding hair and makeup done there though and was very happy. 

But let's move onto NOW. Here's the thing: If you want quality, you MAY have to pay a bit more. Now that I've gone all over Toronto searching for a hair salon, I actually don't find Civello to be that expensive. I mean, consider that you are stuck wearing your hair every day of your life, right? If you had to wear the same pair of jeans every day for 3-4 months, would you buy the $40 pair, or the $200 pair? EXACTLY! Except it's really not crazy expensive and I don't know where I got that idea from exactly....

Okay, so I'm getting off topic.

I went to Civello the first time (since I got my hair styled three years ago for my wedding) at the beginning of the summer. Now there are LOTS of people that work at Civello, so I almost don't want to say who I went with, because I'm worried that everyone is going to start flocking to Civello and demanding this one stylist and I'll never be able to get an appointment ever again (yes, yes, #firstworldproblems). But it wouldn't be fair to him, to not say and it's maybe a little silly to think my yelp review has so much influence on the Toronto community. So yeah, they put me with Byron. 

I feel so selfless!

I had some crappy pictures of what I wanted on my phone, but he worked with them and me. In the end it was gorgeous. Seriously, I wish I had taken pictures it was so pretty.

Approx 4 months later and I'm back again, this time with a few adjustments in mind. 

Once again, I think my hair looks great. 

Besides quality hair, Civello is quick to offer coffee, tea or water. They also give lovely back massages while your hair is setting. Or Byron was getting fresh. Who's to say?

Everyone there is really lovely, but Byron may be one of the better hairdressers I have had. Conversation feels more natural and he has some sort of weird, superpower memory for people, which is both amazing and unsettling. Either way it makes conversation a pleasure. And of course he does hair well, which is why we go to hair salons at the end of the day. Life isn't REALLY like Steel Magnolias...thank God. 

I'm starting to feel weird, like I'm creating some creepy fan club, so I'll just leave it at that. Civello = good.",15,10,4

We went again last weekend and ordered the special, which was amazing as always. We were very hungry, but they gave us two baskets of bread, no problem. One of the nicest things was that I ordered amaretto and ginerale. They brought them out separately and I had to add them together, but they kept bringing me refills of my ginerale. By the end my drink obviously had no more alcohol, but I thought it was so nice that they felt they should refill my drink all the same.

I was sort of expecting a situation were we could design our own cookies and take half a dozen home to enjoy later. But I was informed that the personalized cookies are really best if you have them within an hour of baking them. I'm assuming that then they start going stale. They have regular cookies, but their selection was very limited that evening and we decided to try the thing I'm assuming they're known for. 

My husband ordered oatmeal, with chocolate chunks and m&ms. I ordered peanut butter with toffee and chocolate chips. We waited the couple of minutes for our cookies and got them to go. 

My husband's cookie was not particularly good. It was bland and dry. Tasted off. Mine was much better, but crumbled very easily, like nothing was holding it together. Basically, when you have a cookie that can cook in two minutes, you're sacrificing some rather important elements that make up great cookies. For $2.75\/cookie, I'm not sure it's worth it.

That said, the regular cookies, although not unique, looked good and I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I truly believe they CAN make a good cookie and my cookie tasted quite good. I think I would have rather waited for a bit longer and gotten proper cookies though, myself.

We went with Priceline to get our hotel and were reasonably pleased with getting the Delta Centre-Ville as the hotel we ended up bidding on. It's a pretty good location and an okay price for a 3-1\/2 star hotel in Montreal (from what we were finding were normal prices). We paid around $125 a night, if I remember correctly. However, take into account that parking is around $25 extra per night, so really you're looking at $150\/night...so it's not cheap and I was expecting 3-1\/2 star quality. I did NOT get that.

The lobby looked pretty promising, clean and modern looking, but our room certainly doesn't look like any of those pictures you see on the travel sites. 

The furniture was old and worn. The curtains were also worn and one had a hole in it that looked like it had been burned with a cigarette. The bathroom was very dated. The mirror was all that fake, gold brass, with lightbulbs that got really hot and there was no fan! There was also a single hook in the whole bathroom to hang towels on. Not even a towel holder, just one hook. The wallpaper was old and peeling in places. 

The floor, where the door opened, was ripped and missing chunks. The bedding was old and dingy. There was TONNES of mold on the ceiling where the A\/C vent was. 

In retrospect, we should have complained, but it wasn't so bad we couldn't sleep there, so we made due. 

All this even would have been fine. I would have given it two, maybe even three stars (if I was feeling generous), except for what happened AFTER we checked out.

My sister had put the room on her credit card and she noticed a $100 charge from the hotel on her card when she got home. Since we had gone through Priceline, you pay in advance, so we had already paid for the room. She called up the hotel to ask about the strange charge. 

The girl she spoke with told her that this was a sort of ""downpayment"" that they charge when you check in and assuming you don't make any charges, they reimburse you. So far fine, right? Except this was not explained politely. The girl was very rude and curt in explaining. No one had mentioned this when we checked in and my sister said so. The girl then told my sister that, ""If you ever travelled, then you would KNOW about this sort of thing, because EVERY hotel does it...Are you happy?"" 

My sister was shocked by this response and just said yes and hung up. Then, regaining her bearings and realizing how rude the exchange had been, called back and asked to speak with a manager. She explained to the manager how she had been treated over the phone and the manager said she would speak to the girl. Obviously we have no idea if this happened, or how it was dealt with.

The fact is that 1) We actually travel quite a bit and NO actually Hotel Girl, other hotels do NOT charge you randomly, for no reason and 2) What if we didn't travel often?? How rude to throw it in our faces, as though this is something that any idiot should know, when it hadn't been explained. 

So you know what....I can take the crappy room and old, dingy decor...but I can't take the hotel staff being blatantly rude and obnoxious. I would not recommend this place.",1,1,0

I had a craving for Italian and I had gotten home late and didn't want to spend a lot at a sit down, so we looked this place up and make the trek to check it out.

I actually love the place..it's a total hole in the wall, that has clearly been there for ages. It's a converted house, next to a garage. When you walk inside it looks a bit like a kitchen, with a bunch of tables. The walls are covered in airbrushed Italian scenes and there is a sort of bar to the side, where you place your order.

The menu is quite limited though and I was disappointed that there is not a single pasta dish. Instead this place seems to specialize in sandwiches. 

The gentleman who owns the place and makes the food was really the highlight of this place and would be the reason I would keep coming back. He is sweet and cheerful and kind and was quick to offer us samples to try. 

I ordered eggplant parmesan and my husband ordered a veal sandwich. Everything was fine, although nothing special. My husband ordered a caesar salad and the bacon bits were the sort of fake, packaged kind an the muchrooms for the sandwich were from a can. 

So yes, this food IS made with love, because this gentleman who runs the place is lovely and has a true pride in his food. And the prices are extremely low. But it's still not the best quality and the taste suffers from it.

THAT said, you are not going to find such a large, veal sandwich for as cheap.

For these reasons I sort of equate this place to an Italian Subway sandwich shop. That's not a bad thing! The quality is on par with a fast food sandwich place and the prices are low.

If you've never had Afghani food, I'd compare it too... greek food with added spices. You have different kabobs (or kabAbs as their name implies) and meats of different variety and spices grilled on skewers (mostly).  Add some rice, some garden salad, and you have a middle eastern version of Greek food. 

Anyway, the food is good. Some may find it spicy, but most people I've brought here have really enjoyed it. The dishes are prepared when you order, or close to it, so it can be a 10-15 minute wait for your food.

Nearly all the meat dishes I've had are good here, here's a few:
Kofta: some mixture of beef, garlic and other spices.  It's garlic heavy, so bring some tic-tacs or a tooth brush if you're going back to work. It's the cheapest item, but it'll still fill you up and it's good.  Comes with two skewers.
Chaplee: think of two big burger patties with chilli spices in them. You'll get stuffed. May be a bit hot for some.
Sultani: the king of the dishes, the most expensive, it comes with a skewer of beef tenderloin or filet mignon (forget which, but it's delicious), and a kofta skewer
Tandoori: Tandoori chicken is flavourful, but sometimes a bit dry.  Comes with one skewer.
Chicken: chicken breast  with some spices. My least favorite, as the chicken isn't overly spiced and can be dry at times.

On average, it'll cost you about $10 for a plate without rice, and $13 for a plate with rice, depending on the meat you get of course.

Pro: simple, the food is really good

Cons: a bit pricey for the dinners here, it can be a long wait at lunch since they make the dish when you order, not a huge fan on the naan bread they give you here. It's Afghan type naan, I prefer the Indian naan. This naan, though fresh, is tougher and harder than Indian naan.

Tip: If you're having lunch, I'd suggest getting the kabob plate without rice. It's a few dollars cheaper and the dinner plate with rice will likely put you to sleep at work... it's HEAVY.   The rice though is delicious, so if you go with a group I'd suggest getting individual plates without rice, then ordering a side plate of rice. They give you plenty of rice and it's cheaper this way.  And you can portion it so you don't need an afternoon nap!",4,1,1

If you're in the mood for the meat sweats, the all you can eat menu here is a good choice (and the only thing I've tried the two times I've been). They have a regular menu as well, but I've only tried the all you can eat menu here (twice) so that's all I'm going to review.

For about $28 after tip and taxes on a Friday, you get mounds and mounds of Kalbi ribs, bulgogi beef, pork, and other variations of Korean meats. The quality of the meats is good, and I would say better compared to other Korean BBQ's that I have tried in Toronto.  

The Kalbi Beef is well marinated and you can't wait to dig in as you wait for it to grill up in front of you.  But all the meat is good, and if you and your friends are hungry, this will do the job.

For the weekend dinner, the meal also comes with some ""extras"" which are not all you can eat, last time I got a skewer of shrimp and scallops, and fried shrimp (torpedo style).

As typical for Korean restaurants, they serve a number of side dishes along with your meal, which you can ask to be refilled at any time. These are your typical kimchi, pickled radishes, etc. that you come to expect from any Korean establishment.  

The BBQs here are the typical gas burners, not the coal type which are so rare and hard to find in Toronto.

My biggest criticism with the all you can eat menu here is that you cannot order lettuce or other sides which are typically used to ""wrap"" the meat as part of the menu. Orders of lettuce will cost you extra.  This is a bit confusing to me, as the cost for lettuce is really, really cheap compared to the meat they're providing.

All in all though, I don't think there's anything distinctively special about this place, though if you want a large, unhealthy serving of meat (we all crave this once in a while) then it's a good choice.",3,0,1

You'd think it's easy to cook, but there really is an art to it. The right batter with good seasoning, the right temperature to the oil, crisp fries and for the love of God, fresh fish! So given the great ratings on Yelp, I was pretty excited to finally have the chance to try Fresco's... and boy was I disappointed. 

I was expecting greatness, but what I got was a small portion of overcooked, dry and flavorless fish and soggy and under seasoned fries for $15.

I had the halibut, and being my first time I had it done half and half (half regular batter, half Ms. Vickie's).  The Ms. Vickie's batter is definitely the better of the two, have more crunch and texture, while the regular batter was soft and just not good. 

The fish wasn't overly oily, which is good, but the fish itself was very dry.  You know how in good fish and chips, the fish will flake apart? That lovely texture that just falls apart in your mouth? Well, this isn't it. The fish was chewy, dry and definitely wasn't seasoned. I ended up throwing a ton of seasoning salt, lemon and tartar sauce on it just to give it some life. 

Onto the second part of the equation: fries. They sure looked delicious, but again the lack of seasoning hurt the verdict, and the fries were a big soggy to boot.  

I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I expected a lot more from a place which has a 4.5 stars average rating on Yelp (which I treat like the bible).

Or maybe I was just in a mind-altered-movie-state during TIFF weekend. 

Any ways, even on a Friday afternoon Gryfe's had a few customers in line, each ordering a dozen of whichever types of bagels they had on hand. When they're fully stocked, there's about a dozen varieties, although they're all fairly traditional choices: sesame, poppy seed, extra poppy seed, flax, everything, cinnamon raisin, plain, etc. Soft, fluffy and airy, these bagels are pretty good if you're into that kinda thing. They're $0.60 each or $7.20 a dozen. 

That being said, I personally enjoy bagels with a it more chew and texture to them (like Montreal style bagels), but regardless, the carb-monster inside of me made yet another appearance when I picked these up, as I quickly devoured two bagels and an apple turnover.  I can certainly see why folks like the bagels, IF they like the soft and fluffy variety. They also toast up pretty well, which adds some good texture to it and is much more down my alley. The apple turnover ($1.15) was good, though the apple filling could have used more cinnamon. 

They ran out of their $1 pizzas by Friday afternoon, since they're closed on Saturday and don't want to bake more in case they don't sell out that night. Great to know that everything here is fresh!

If you do come here, I'd suggest you do not come on a Friday afternoon, as a lot of their bagel varieties and pizzas are sold out.

Cordi has freshly baked Caldenese bread, rye bread, bagels, croissants, and an assortment of Italian pastries including cannolis, chocolate cannolis, zeppole, cinnamon buns, cakes and whatnot.  They also had a deli section which had a few people ordering from.

I picked up a cannoli, a chocolate cannoli, a cinnamon bun and a zeppole. 

My virgin experience with a zeppole, so I can't really compare, but it the zeppole is SUPER creamy, sort of like a donut with massive amounts of cream and cheese. It was alright. I'll have to try out zeppole at some other bakeries to really compare. 

The cannolis had a crunchy shell and creamy filling with chocolate chips.  A nice crunchy shell (nothing worse than a soggy\/soft shell on a cannoli) but the shell was a bit too thick for my liking. All in all it was good though. 

The cinnamon bun was average, nothing to rave about and comparable to what you could get at other bakeries or a supermarket.

For those who want to read on:
The owners of this little spot are brave souls, with Paramount, Bamiyan Kababa and Pita & Grill all within the vicinity of this restaurant, they're going to have some tough competition. 

This small shop located at the corner of Dixie and Eglington (connected to the Canadian tire gas bar store and Mary Browns) servers up falafel, chicken and beef schwarmas and dinner plates. I think they also have chicken breast kebabs, but I can't be sure. It's a small menu and small shop, meant to be a quick grab and go. 

Some smart cookies running the place. They had a $2.99 promo running last week for a falafel, chicken or beef schwarma to get the word out (regular $5.99) and it did manage to generate some buzz as there were fairly long lines during lunch for the special. For $2.99, it's a steal...for $5.99.......... questionable. 

I tried the chicken shawarma. The chicken didn't have much flavor, there wasn't a whole lot of meat, but it was larger than the tiny sandwich offerings at Paramount.  It was your standard chicken shawarma, topped with the standard lettuce, tomato, garlic sauce and hummus (you can add parsley as well, which I would recommend), wrapped in your standard pita and grilled in your standard panini press for several seconds. It may be because the line was long and they were trying to get people through, but the shawarma wasn't put in the press for long enough to do it's work. The whole thing was just standard, middle of the road shawarma. 

As I mentioned, there are other middle eastern options in the area, and in my opinion they're all better than Anoush.  I was told the beef was better, and I'm willing to give it another try. Maybe it'll be a different experience if they're not rushed because of long lines.",2,0,0

I tried the double-double.  The loosely packed patty is nicely cooked, seared on the outside and oh so juicy on the inside.  The bread and lettuce are fresh, and the cheese is beautifully melted; the double double was reminiscent of some of the finer burger's I've had in my life, most comparable to Shake Shack in NYC.

I want to knock off a star because of the price point ($9 after taxes is a bit pricey for a smallish double patty burger - think In' n' out size - with no drinks or fries, out of the downtown core with no seating), but this place is the best I've had in the GTA, so I'll give it 5 until I find some place better.

Because of the location and price point, I won't be frequenting frequently, but I'll have to drop by next time I've a craving for a good ol' burger!",0,0,0

During a quick trip back to TO, a friend mentioned I should try this new joint that serves up Chinese Jamaican food. Not having had Chinese food nor Jamaican food in a while I wandered up to Bathurst and Dundas to find a small joint with a fun, modern deco Caribbean vibe - not exactly what I expected in the area. 

Starting with some TGIF drinks, they had a decent beer menu, but the cocktails were awesome. You can even get them in a ""teapot"" which is not only cute, but great value - I think there were like 6 or 7 drinks in there. Try the one with 5 spice and ginger beer, and thank me later. (seriously, Yelp Thank You's are appreciated :) )

Between a few of us we tried a lot, but the real winners here are the Dirty Fried Rice, the Jerk Chicken, Double Down Patty and burger. 
 
You know when you expecting something to be a certain way, but then it's not? Like when you're sure your parents bought you another sweater for Christmas, the box is the right size and shape, but you open it up and you find out it was a camouflaged box and inside is the most awesomest Ninja Turtles toy ever (true story). That's my impression of Patios. Everything has a familiarity to it - but with a twist that makes you think, ""wow, that's different"". 

Case in point, the fried rice: looking at it you think, ""this is going to taste like every other fried rice I've had in my life"", but when you take that first bite: BAM. It's got this nice sweet twist that I can't put my finger on. But it that makes you think, why isn't fried rice always made like this? 

Now the burger... man... the burger is done with a pineapple bun (in Chinese, it's called a bo lo bao), this awesome Chinese bread with a slightly sweet\/crunchy\/bready topping that just about every Chinese kid loved growing up. Throw a double patty in the middle of that thing? Brilliant. 

If you're like me and have a thing for rotisserie chicken, you'll love the jerk. It's not your typical jerk chicken that's slathered in sauce, but it's well spiced, a good flavor without being overwhelming, and juicy as heck from the rotisserie. Pair it with a spicy (as heck) sauce, and you got a winner. 

The double-down patty is twist on Colonel Sander's invention, throwing a thick slab of good-ol bacon and melted cheese between two Jamaican patties. Seriously, throwing those ingredients together is like using a cheat code. 

Being away from Toronto for a few months and coming back, it quickly reminded me of the awesome food we have here and the familiarity of the food gave me a sense of deja vu, combining oldies I loved with a new twist.",8,4,4

Don't: come here expecting pork!

Chinese Halal. Um, what? Say that again? Chinese. Halal.
I'll have to admit, this was a complete head scratcher for me. Who knew these was such cuisine? Located at the back of plaza at Leslie & Finch, I met a friend for lunch here and was pleasantly surprised at the twist on Chinese dishes here. 

My friend said the food is actually classified as Islamic, so all the dishes are lamb or beef. 

I've got to say, I've seen seen so many different preparations of lamb before.

Lamb ribs coated with sesame and pan fried, interesting... and delicious! The lamb was soft and tasty, though I would have loved it more if the skin were a bit crispier. ($13)

The lamb soup comes loaded with lamb meat, so make sure you scoop from the bottom! ($9)

The lamb leg is the only dish I'd pass on again. For $9 it's a small piece of lamb and a bit too salty for my liking.

The beef lung (yes, lung. This is Asian cuisine folks, not Fear Factor!) was spicy and had a texture similar to tripe, loved it! ($8)

And while I didn't try it, the lamb stuffed pan fried buns look awesome and ginormous, and apparently they are the speciality here (I wish my friend told me that BEFORE we ordered).  Will definitely be back to try those.

I wouldn't drive too far out of my way to come here, but if you're up for a twist on your regular har gow and siu mei, and like lamb, I'd recommend it.",5,2,1

The review:
Any Pho place with nice decor is automatically suspect in my books. The better pho I've had has usually been at dives and places where you make sure you wipe down your utensils before using them. So walking into WonderPho alarms immediately went off.

I came here without reading any Yelp reviews, and after reading them now, my experience was similar. 

More expensive than other places, and cruddy service (we were the ONLY table there, yet the waiter didn't come by once during our meal to check up on us. I had to call him over i.e. yell, to get more water).  

I ordered the Seafood Pho. DO NOT GET IT.  It's one of the more expensive items on the menu, but you get two mussels, two pieces of fake crab, two tiny shrimps, and two tiny pieces of overcooked squid.  Definitely get one the beef base Pho or Curry dishes.

The positives are that the noodles themselves were actually decent, and from what I could tell of my friend's beef broth and curry broths, those were ok as well. The base isn't quite as oily as other Pho places, which is good or bad, depending how you look at it. 

Based on the seafood Pho alone, there's much better Pho to be had. And with plenty of options in that area (Dragon Pearl, a thai and japanese buffet next door, kelseys, coras, pizza, wings, freshi, etc.) unless you're craving Pho, I'd go somewhere else.

If I do end up coming again, I'll be sure to try a Rare Beef Pho (i.e. a 101 at most places) to compare the staple and report back.",3,0,0

For lunch, this location is packed like a mall on Christmas eve, especially considering the location is fairly tucked away. 

With this amount of turnover, the food is fresh and pretty good.  I wouldn't say the meat is substantially better than other schwarma places in the area, such as Pita & Grill, nothing that blows me away.  The portions of the sandwich are also pretty small.

The best thing is probably the pita bread, which is really fresh and is all puffy and steaming when it gets to your table. 

The hummus is creamier than most other places.

Garlic sauce is alright, but I think the one at Pita & Grill up the street is better.

I think this place is a bit overpriced, ($11 + tax for a chicken schwarma plate, I've uploaded a pic of their price list) for what you get compared to other schwarma places.

G5BqF32PyIQ5IvplDvpKnA,Colin,fqeHgAtcUxp2ocf_RLErkg,"""Sally Beauty Supply""",4,30-01-2014,"I have to say that this is probably one of my favorite spots now! So here is the thing that everybody needs to know about Brews Brothers or what I want you to know... When you think of Brew Brothers, don't think gourmet meal or anything. 

Think, awesome burger and great beer with your friends after work and just letting the aches and pains of the day run through you like your 20oz beer does. Now for Wisconsinites, here is why it is fantastic; BEER. Beer, beer and more beer. There are so many beer choices and GOOD beer choices that it takes me literally 5-10 minutes to decide. It's cheap, plentiful, and delicious and there is a beer there for everybody (including cider for those not bold enough). The food is better than I expected and REALLY good for a place, that I like to call, ""a dive-chain."" What do you mean Colin?! You're not making any sense! Well I mean, Brews Brothers is in fact a chain. It's not a LARGE chain, with only two locations, but in the sense of the word it is. 

Now the reason I call it a dive-chain is because it really isn't taking itself too seriously. They really make you feel hey, grab a couple beers, have a burger, laugh with your friends, and we'll see you next week. They exhibit their beers in front of you as you walk up to the bar as if it were a museum or parade of beer and it is something to be marveled at. So many beer taps striving for your attention. The greasy smell of burgers attacking your nose urging you to have one. It is simply a relaxing place to go. Staff? INCREDIBLY friendly and really make you feel like a regular. Now for those who know my posts etc. They know I love it when a place makes you feel as though you've never left and thats exactly how they make you feel. 

Now I REALLY really want to give this 5 stars but there are two big things that are nagging me. The first is the location, it is in sort of an odd place which is in between a sub shop and salad shop with a Yoga studio upstairs in a strip mall. It would be great if they were lucky enough to have a stand alone building but, such is life. The second is that I feel in this age and in Madison, even a beer bar needs to offer some liquor. I have had friends join me at this wonderful spot to be really disappointed that they didn't offer any sort of liquor. They settled for cider (simply because they don't drink beer) which is crazy to most but I understood it.\

Simply put by their own slogan (on the back of their shirts, and yes, one that I bought...) ""Brews Brothers: Where good people drink good beer",1,0,0

I will say that their selection is not the greatest here, it seems to be more Desks and Office chairs than anything. All the electronics are either not there or broken, but everything else is ok. Things are clean and organized and you don't have to go on a scavenger hunt for anything. Well laid out store so you don't feel pressured into other isles. 

Now the kicker to this place is the staff in my opinion. They are anything but helpful. Although I never asked a question or anything they were very concerned with their plans for the weekend and other work related drama when I arrived and departed. Not once did anyone ask if they could help me find something or if there was something particular I was looking for. You could here them talking and laughing from the back of the store which, i'm all for good fun at work but when you are that loud in a large store which customers are looking for something and just hear you laughing somewhere?

However, I feel that once you find someone they are extremely helpful, at least in my experiences. They are always willing to find you the size you need and haven't taken too long to grab shoes or anything from the back.

I will say over the holiday season they are a bit better but that is to be expected. Finally, It can get a little messy in here when it is busy but again they seem to be understaffed which I feel for. I have actually seen one person consistently working here for about 2 years now and it seems like they never get a day off.

The older-style seats, floor, and stage with a couple of nice modern things thrown in to give it an updated feel. They have a second upper level which is sort of oddly proportioned and designed. It almost goes straight up so that people on the second level can have a view of the stage but it is very steep. So if you are intoxicated, I suggest staying on the first level... Furthermore the bar and drinks here are actually better priced than most concert places... It was $4 for a 16oz PBR which ya... It's PBR but for $4? Can't go wrong! The acoustics are pretty good but could be better because sound doesn't carry well in there for some reason. Also the bathrooms in the basement are absolutely disgusting and for some reason they always allow girls to come into the men's room if the women's is full...

They have EVERYTHING here. Legends is kind of tucked away near the West Towne mall and the next most recognizable thing nearby is a Chucky Cheese. Straight away the only qualm I have with the place is the parking lot. Not enough parking what-so-ever. Not the end of the world though. You walk in through a corner entrance to reveal a huge wrap-around bar with TONS of tables and stools surrounding it.

There is a huge screen at the front along with dart boards to get you started on the Sports bar feel. Pool table in the opposing corner with a few slots as well. Now the kickers of this place. First the big screen at the front? That is mainly reserved for very large UFC fights!!!! YES one of very few bars in Madison will show them because of how costly they are to show. Can't get a great view of the screen? don't worry. They have probably over 15 other TV's surrounding the bar attached to the ceiling. I am not exaggerating one bit. You can't escape a TV in this place even if you wanted to. Which is awesome because they show pretty much every kind of sport known to man. The outdoor patio on the side if large and plentiful of seating where they still play the audio for games and yet you still have a clear view inside the window at current games.

Head around to the back of the bar and there is a full-size volley ball court! Leagues and all. The other immediate thing you will notice is the awesome new Tiki Shack bar they HAND BUILT with a large (around 50"") TV mounted against the wall. They don't stock a ton back there but another pitcher of mediocre beer? Sure! They have bean bag boards and sometimes some special events like $1 Cheese burgers and not too long ago they even had a full-size lamb cooking back there! IT WAS DELICIOUS. They also have live music back there sometimes with a little stage in the corner, no real big names or anything but more than what any other kind of place would have.

Most importantly, the employees and the family that owns this place is spectacular. They make you feel like a regular even if this is your first time there. If your a regular you feel like family. The owner of this place is always genuinely concerned with how you might be doing and how you are in his company and the establishment. If not my favorite #1 bar it is a very close second but I might be brave and say it is.

I do quite like Banana Republic but I suppose that is an entirely different store. SO This gap... Well I will say that due to the type of clientele, they have and absolutely perfect spot in Madison. I have shopped here a couple different times and it seems every time has been different. Times I have gone in and never been helped when obviously looking for something, other times there have been a surplus of employees. 

Men's department is slight compared to the women's department which is ok I guess but a little disappointing considering the other Gap is in the West Towne mall which is Miles away. Store is always very clean and the dressing rooms are empty without clutter almost every time I have been there. They have a great AD behind the registers which is bright and can sort of just boost your mood... until you walk up to it and it gives you a migraine.

Let me paint you a word picture people. You walk into this little hole-in-the-wall type place by being drawn like a moth to a light with a HUGE white awning from the street. You pass some quaint outdoor seating and enter into a somewhat confusing maze to find some of the main seating and the bar. Rich wood surrounding you as it melts you into relaxation before you even reach the bar at the back of the establishment. You explore this tightly packed place by walking down some stairs to another bar, which I am going to call ""the speak easy"" with white lounge seating in an intimate space that exudes class. Candles lit and people chatting.

Coming back upstairs, My buddy and I had some cocktails and steak sandwiches in what I call the ""Middle Al Capone room"" The reason I say that is because I imagine Al Capone sitting in the corner of this all wood room underneath the small little wall lamps with a stogie and a cognac relaxing after a hard day of moonshine running... Soothing lighting throughout with small intimate booths with some close friends. This is it... Probably going to be my new favorite place....",4,3,4

I hate to say that but they pretty much are. Similar layout, similar products, similar prices.

This particular location is seated well between West Towne Wall but closer the West Gate Mall. They have the standard thingamabobs and doodads for all your office needs at, in my opinion, probably the cheapest in the city. They actually have a little bigger selection than their competitors but I think that is based on sheer age of the company. Office Depot has been around since I can remember and was ALWAYS the first stop for school supplies.

So, the company has been around forever and they have the cheapest prices in town you say? So Colin, why only 3 stars then?! WELL ILL TELL YA... (dramatic effect) I give a three star rating for essentially one reason. Lack Of Change. This Office Depot hasn't changed since I was a wee-little-lad back in first grade.

I have not seen any advertisements or bilboards for Office Depot in a very long time and can't imagine they're doing very well.

This particular location has a lot going for it and some not so much. The things I like most about it, is the location and the interior. This location is found right smack dab on the corner of Fish Hatchery Road and Park Street which is a HUGELY traveled intersection near downtown Madison. Plenty of sitting space, some comfy chairs and even a darkened area that seems... I don't know, quaint. It isn't super busy every time I have been here but it isn't dead either. Staff has been sometimes inattentive and once or twice downright rude but it only happened once or twice so I won't hold it against them. They also have an internet area in the back I think. I tend to stay toward the front of the store so I am not sure but I thought that was a really nice addition. 9 out of 10 times the store is spotless and finally it isn't cramped.

Now onto some not so nice things (Sad Face). So the things I dislike most about this location are 1. the bathroom, and yes I know it seems mundane but if you read some of my other reviews this can make or break it. It isn't always as clean as it could be to put it nicely. 

Another issue I have, Ironically enough, is the location. I know I said I enjoy the location and I do but it is right on the main drag so if you are there on a nice summers day or around 8:00, 12:00, or 4-6:00, all you will see is bustling traffic. Which, if you are trying to relax, is not the first thing that springs to mind. The other issue is that it doesn't seem to be as busy as it should be for being where it is. Why isn't that place packed all day! The reason I have found for this is that there is not much parking without walking a bit, which is great in the summer maybe or if your younger, but not so much in the winter. There is street parking but it is regulated so much that you would end up moving your car anyway. They have about 6 spots along the back of store but thats it.

So because I love their coffee and atmosphere so much this place gets a difficult 5 stars. The reason if because I don't want to have to park on a greatly busy street and cleanliness of the bathroom.

They have an upper ""balcony"" or terrace type thing looking down onto the main floor which was really cool. It was almost like a little getaway area. Beer selection? Extensive with some of the most interesting types of beers i have tasted in a while. They also have 1 pool table along with a dart board and some sort of video game... There was also some type of game in the right corner as you walk in but I cannot remember what. They have a jukebox there but from the looks of it, it seems to be a decoration but who knows.

This place was a lot of fun, relatively small compared to other places like it but great acoustics and oh, kind of a weird thing to add but extremely clean bathrooms! For some reason it was like entering a different world walking into the bathroom like it was part of a very nice restaurant or something but that is a good thing! The one bad thing about this place as far as my experience went, were some very... Distinguished people who really weren't concerned with your personal space or whether they bump into you or not but they were quick to spin around and say excuse me. To sum it all up?

I do not like this store at all though. I have been here about 5 times in total and each time they have something intriguing in the window so I have a peak in side. The store is the size of a walk-in closet and everything is completely overpriced. The selection is awful and most things seem to be made out of cardboard. The staff are unhelpful completely and seem to only be there for some great discounts and a paycheck.  Sometimes you can find a Gem in here but then you see the price tag and have to go sell your car. I can't see anyone except for a celebrity shopping here and justifying the price they would pay.  

Again, I am all for some expensive clothing if you feel great in it, for example for men's jeans maybe $200 tops and they had better be spectacular and last for decades.

I was not that happy with my experience. It started off excellently by first finding the tires I would like (which I love cars and knew what I was talking about and the sales person knew that straight away) which had to be ordered. No problem, total was $700 put $100 down, done and done. They even had the lowest price of even online for the tires I wanted! 

Now I had a scheduled time to put them on but with the warranty and such I didn't want to put them on too early which would 1. run down the warranty because it is on a mileage basis and 2. I didn't want to wear down the tread of the tires because it hadn't even snowed yet. So I pushed out the install date and it ended up being after the blizzard because as predicted... my norma tires were awful in the snow.

So I asked what the soonest time was to have them installed and took the time. The day arrives and I head in expecting to pay the remaining $600 for the tires. I had even called to confirm that my initial $100 didn't expire or was returned. Sat around and waited for them to finish and was called up to pay the balance. ""Alright your so your total is $700.68"" I said what? that can't be right. 

I told the sales person (same person I dealt with THE FIRST time I came in) that I had just called to confirm my $100 was still on there. He said yeah it is but the rest is $700. I said for what? For the four tires, no waste disposal (since I kept my tires) and the replacement on all four tires. I said I never discussed the replacement plan with anyone nor with the sales person for that matter. He kind of acted dumb and looked at his colleague like ""HUH wonder how that dun got on there"" Which I was not happy about. Come to find out, they do this to almost EVERYONE, they add it onto every sale without telling you because they make a commission off of the sale.

The whole time I was there they were asking each other who was on that sale or who's sale was it? I told the SP I didn't ask for it and don't want it and to take it off. Now I will say the replacement plan is sort of nice a $25 per tire its replaced no matter what happens, nail or pot hole... However its not nice if they don't tell you. In the end the guy covered all four tires for the price of three which I even argued there and hope one tire goes just to even out the cost.

Here are the final parts. I should have mentioned earlier that because of where I work, I got a 10% discount as well off the whole deal but the dollar mounts i'm talking about is with that included. After I purchased the tires and had them installed I later went online to make sure the price hadn't come down on the tires. Which lead me to a rebate page... WHICH MY TIRES QUALIFIED FOR... buy four michelin tires and receive a $70 rebate. I was never told this once while working with my sales person nor by anybody else. I filed for it and got declined for some-odd reason (probably because I filed for the rebate the same day) but ended up calling the corporate office to find out why. The people over the phone were SO sympathetic about the replacement plan and the rebate issue. They approved my rebate Immediately and I received a couple of weeks later. 

Even though it all worked out I still wasn't told about spending an extra $100 for a replacement plan I never asked for, I was never told about the rebate which probably would have inclined me to purchase the replacement plan in full and pretty much got the run-around in store as to why it was on there.

G5BqF32PyIQ5IvplDvpKnA,Colin,WfdYDcDRg15IUQOzJNReAQ,"""Cafe Presse""",3,03-12-2012,"So I have been coming to this location ever since I could play video games pretty much. I have to say that I have met quite a few really nice and kind people who work here and they used to do a spectacular job. I have to say that in the recent year or two they have kind of lacked in good customer service. Let's start with some of the basic things in a review.

The location of this place is pretty great. It is right near the West Towne Mall on Madison's west side and it's in the ""Target Plaza"" where they have a lot of other great shopping. It is RIGHT on Mineral Point road so you can see it right as you pass it. The store itself is well kept and cleanly and is most of the time neatly organized. Always have the latest games, almost never have to wait for stock to come in. The other nice thing about this location being so close to the mall is that there is another Gamestop inside the mall. So if one or the other is out of stock on something usually the other store will have at least one or two in stock. These are some of the great things about this location... However...

Whoever has read my review before will know that I am very concerned with Customer Service. The people who work at an establishment are the biggest deciding factor of whether I will enjoy a place or not. This place used to have some absolutely great employees that were always willing to help, explain the plot of a game. Tell you why you should or shouldn't buy a game, analyze the games that you may currently play and what games coming out you may be interested in. The people working there now just seem to expect you to know what your looking for and to buy it and reserve something else. I also like to give examples so let me give you my last one that seemed to have been the same experience for the last year and a half. 

I just went in here to get rid of some games I no longer play and get some coffee money. I was the only one in the store when I walked in and I was never greeted nor even looked at. So I perused for a moment or two then walked up to the counter to sell my items. As I walked up, 1 of the 2 workers never looked up at me as they walked away and into the back of the store. The other had his back turned to me and was continuing on some other task. I politely said excuse me as the gentleman spun around and said ""oh, the other guy will be right back i'm finishing something right now."" I said alright cause I don't mind waiting, but about 5-10 minutes went by and I was still standing there so I started looking around a bit more when I look back to the counter the person who had his back to me was now on his phone doing nothing. I walked back up and he immediately turned back to ""what he was finishing."" The other employee finally returned and asked if I wanted to sell the games I was holding in my hand. I said yes and he started ringing me out. He immediately asked for my ID and then gave me a receipt for store credit. Now I wouldn't have minded if I wanted to reserve another game or purchase something else in the near future but I rarely play video games anymore.

I said oh I was actually looking for cash and instead of apologizing he very condescendingly said ""Really? you know that's like half of what you have right now"" I said I didn't care because I had all the games I wanted and that I don't play games that much anymore. He sort of rolled his eyes, ""umm... ok?"" he protested... Handed me my cash and didn't say a word so I left. I don't hold this against the store as a whole because I have had pleasant times here but that was outrageous. So hopefully they hire some more spritely and excited people about anyone who comes in. The video game market is not doing so hot so to exile people like that is just hurting it more. Getting people excited about games again is what they are all about! So I will continue shopping here for now but instead of an A-OK rating its more of an eh.... OK... rating.",0,3,0

This place is gonna take some describing so bare with me. You enter through a door in the corner of the bar where you first see an ATM (hint hint) and then find some seating to your right and the bar straight ahead. As you walk towards the bar, the place kind of bottlenecks where you find the stairs to an upstairs, the door the outdoor patio and lots of bar height tables. 

The bar is runs almost the length of the building then wraps around a bit near the kitchen. BTW they make some GREAT bar food especially a patty melt that was soo good I ordered it immediately the next time I went. Anywho... They have a TON of draft beers and a TON of different liquors. Great big TV's right at the bar to be able to watch any game you want and then they also have a massive projection screen for some of the bigger games as well and to watch from upstairs.They also have some of the most friendly staff I have ever met in my entire life. THEY ARE GREAT! Great doesn't even describe it. They're jubilant! Yeah, that's right your learning new words!

Anyways, Moving on to the upstairs, They have a pool table A SECOND smaller bar and another set of TV's! They also have darts and lots more seating up their. On most nights the upstairs is nice and quiet and not crowed at all so you can usually sneak in a couple games of pool and darts. Oh and this place is usually pretty clean but its a dive bar so spills can happen. Finally the outdoor patio wraps around the back of the bar just a tad and has some nice tables to sit at as well. Jeez, with all the seating you could sit a small town in there and it doesn't seem like that big of a building. Like I said it has some great staff, a nice building, and lots of seating. And great patty melts.. mmmm ok thats it i'm going to get one when i'm done with this review. Get on down there to watch some good sports, and eat and drink well without busting the bank.

An hour in and I quite frankly was ready for the show to finish up. I didn't find the acrobatics flowing smoothly while suspended above.  Let's chat about the children in the white masks, creepy. I know the amount of reviews are highly rated of this show.  More than half the theater was empty.  The entire row in front of us was vacant.  To my left our entire row was empty. The entire row behind us- yes, empty. Yet, we had two people seated right next to us.  
Indeed we inquired about spreading out a bit- absolutely not we were told.  What prompted our question was the man directly to our right spoke the entire show. Nope, not in a whisper regular speaking tone.  Heard his every word Perfectly clear over the music.  I gave him a stare down a few times and yes!  I made mention about him speaking. He clearly had the me, me, me syndrome. As did his wife, her shoes were off (no socks) and she had them hanging over the seats in front of her.  I heard more of him than the show!

Third time was far from a charm.
Other Mama conveys a sense of 'busy-ness', it indeed is a room with a low ceiling and dark walls. I arrived before the others in my party. Yes, indeed I had a reservation.
As I glimpsed around I noticed five available tables, as well as available bar space. 
I was 'greeted' by an unprofessional female, whom requires experience in communication.  I informed her I made a previous reservation (she never inquired about the name or how many). A few happenings and horrendous communication transpired for fifteen minutes regarding if I may sit at the bar.  Will spare her and the person she questioned he embarrassment of that.  This said person should have addressed me bubble- he did not. 
She then returns for a third time... 
Blurts out: we are slammed. Then motions towards the seat by the door\/slash 'hostess area'.  Tells me 'sit there' and she will bring me a drink. I glimpse around the room, which is the size of a basement.  I still see five empty tables (in addition with the empty seating at the bar).  I provided her with an unpleasant tone along with a sarcastic and curt reply: apparently so (in response for her ''we are slammed').  Thinking, one would catch on and have a manager come speak with me- no.  Now, she motions at one of those empty tables and tells me you sit there then.  I was more than put off at this point.  My fault for not leaving.

A decent amount of time has transpired after ordering the halibut (should've had the halibut at this point). Our party watches other diners who were seated well after us received their food and finish entire meals.  
I notice a man approach the board and erase the halibut. Light bulb goes off now- run out of that halibut did you...
Forty five minutes have gone by since ordering the halibut.  I will refrain from my initial thought of what these three halibut dishes appeared in resembling.  I will accompany a picture of one of the three halibuts.  Make note that the halibut dish posted was the 'most appealing' one of the three.  None were appealing.
